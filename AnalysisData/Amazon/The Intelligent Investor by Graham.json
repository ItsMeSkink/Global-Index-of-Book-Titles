Since its original publication in 1949, Benjamin Graham's book has remained the most respected guide to investing, due to his timeless philosophy of \"value investing,\" which helps protect investors against the areas of possible substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies with which they will be comfortable down the road. Over the years, market developments have borne out the wisdom of Benjamin Graham's basic policies. Here he takes account of both the defensive and the enterprising investor, outlining the principles of stock selection for each, and stressing the advantages of a simple portfolio policy. Among the book's special features are the use of numerous comparisons of pairs of common stocks to bring out their elements of strength and weakness and the construction of investment portfolios designed to meet specific requirements of quality and price attractiveness. The Intelligent Investor may be the most important book you will ever read on making your investments a success. \" The Intelligent Investor is the best book ever written for the stockholder,\" says author and investment counselor John Train. Benjamin Graham's classic work offers sound and safe principles for investing-principles that have worked for more than forty years since the first edition was published. With an introduction and appendix by Warren Buffett, one of Graham's most famous students in investing strategy, this book takes account of both the defensive and the enterprising investor. \"By far the best book on investing ever written.\" -- Warren E. Buffett \"There have been other good books written about money since 1841, but only a few hold up. The best known and most likely to make you money is The Intelligent Investor .\" -- Andrew Tobias \"Graham ranks as this century's (and perhaps history's) most important thinker on applied portfolio investment.\" -- John Train, author of The Money Masters",

    "description": "This is a list of 1101 + quotes from Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger and Benjamin Graham . The list has no special order. This is an effort to collect, inspiring and wise quotes attributed to Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger and Benjamin Graham. Certainly, one of them can transform you to become a better investor. Trying to emulate Warren Buffett\u2019s investment success is hard, because his results are so extreme that the role of luck in his lifetime performance is very likely high, and luck isn\u2019t something you can reliably emulate. Plenty of books are dedicated to how Warren Buffett built his fortune. Many of them are wonderful. But few pay enough attention to the simplest fact: Buffett\u2019s fortune isn\u2019t due to just being a good investor but being a good investor since he was literally a child. Graham\u2019s classic book, The Intelligent Investor, is more than theory. It gives practical directions like formulas investors can use to make smart investing decisions. Charlie Munger once said \u201cI did not intend to get rich. I just wanted to get independent.\u201d We can leave aside rich, but independence has always been my personal financial goal. Chasing the highest returns or leveraging my assets to live the most luxurious life has little interest to me. Both look like games people do to impress their friends, and both have hidden risks. I mostly just want to wake up every day knowing my family and I can do whatever we want to do on our own terms. Every financial decision we make revolves around that goal.",

Graham's method advises investors to concentrate on the real-life performance of their companies and the dividends they receive, rather than paying attention to the changing sentiments of the market. Graham also advocated for an investing approach that provides a margin of safety\u2014or room for human error\u2014for the investor. Most importantly, investors should look for price-value discrepancies\u2014when the market price of a stock is less than its intrinsic value.",

    "description": "\u201cThey laid out a road map for investing that I have now been following for 57 years. There\u2019s been no reason to look for another.\u201d \u2015Warren Buffett, on the writings of Benjamin Graham Legendary investing author and philosopher Benjamin Graham lived through interesting times. Soon after his graduation from Columbia College, the nation entered the First World War. As the stock market fluctuated in wild dips and peaks, the government seized control of the railroad industry, inflation and interest rates rose dramatically, and economic depression loomed on the horizon. During these events\u2015and perhaps inspired by them\u2015Graham began writing articles for The Magazine of Wall Street , putting to paper his earliest ideas on value investing and security analysis. For the first time, these important works have been anthologized into a single volume. Benjamin Graham on Investing is a treasure trove of rare and out-of-print articles that document the early flashes of genius from a man whose ideas and theories would revolutionize investment philosophy and inspire the careers of such luminaries as Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Charlie Munger, and countless other top-tier investors. The early works of Benjamin Graham have never been as relevant as they are today. The world\u2019s markets are undergoing changeon a scale not unlike that of Graham\u2019s era. David Darst, one of the world\u2019s most respected experts on asset allocation, provides insightful analyses connecting Graham\u2019s articles to events today. ,i>Benjamin Graham on Investing is a timeless classic that continues to have relevance more than 30 years after the author\u2019s death.",

    "description": "Economist Benjamin Graham, best known for his book The Intelligent Investor, is lauded as a top guru of finance and investment. Known as the father of value investing, The Intelligent Investor: The Definitive Book on Value Investing is considered one of the most important books on the topic. Graham's method advises investors to concentrate on the real-life performance of their companies and the dividends they receive, rather than paying attention to the changing sentiments of the market. Graham also advocated for an investing approach that provides a margin of safety\u2014or room for human error\u2014for the investor. Most importantly, investors should look for price-value discrepancies\u2014when the market price of a stock is less than its intrinsic value.",

    "description": "Discover the fortune that lies hidden in the stock market for everyone who wants to quit work someday. Will the stock market crash? Find out where and how to grow and protect your money over the next decade to get stellar returns, using this investment guide. Almost fifty years have passed since Benjamin Graham wrote his seminal work The Intelligent Investor. Right now, at the start of 2021, we suspect he would be thinking \u201canother stock market bubble.\u201d What\u2019s incredible is that most investors would agree with him (according to Robert Schiller\u2019s crash confidence index)\u2014but the stock market keeps growing and growing. Some of Graham\u2019s advice is timeless\u2014look for and buy value, and the rewards will come. However, renowned proponents of this advice, such as Warren Buffett, have not always found it easy to put into practice. Buffett had to sit on his hands for much of the past five or six years as value has been hard to find before finally investing (post-pandemic) in Japan in 2020. Sometimes you need immense patience and calm to follow Graham\u2019s advice when everyone around you is making huge returns in a raging bull market. But does it pay off, or would you have just missed the investment returns of your lifetime? Although the fundamentals of value investing have not changed, much of the advice in The Intelligent Investor was last updated in 1972. Fifty years of massive change in our markets, society, and technology has rendered a lot of the more specific information dated and worthless. Everyone wants to know what the future will hold and predict where markets are going. Up or down? Is it the bottom or the top? Will we have deflation or inflation or even hyperinflation? Knowing the answer to these questions would, of course, be of massive financial benefit and remove much of the stress and worry from how we organize our financial affairs. In this book you will discover: What is the thing most likely to trigger the next market crash and how to watch for it? Seven investment types, which one will suit you? What comes out top between growth and value investing, and why? Does Cathie Wood trounce Buffet, or will Warren have the last laugh? Whether you should you invest in Asia or other markets Are retiring Boomers going to make markets slump? If you were given $1,000,000 to invest is this the portfolio you would buy? Are the best days over for the passive investors? How little mistakes keep you poor. How to construct a dynamic portfolio \u2013 that will deliver superior returns in all conditions And much, much more. The author (Tom Cromwell) has a wealth of personal and commercial financial experience and an upbringing that showed him the value of every penny. He has invested money from his earned income for 30 years, and is an example of how it is possible to rise to wealth and prosperity from a disadvantaged situation. Tom believes in financial empowerment for everyone because your goals were his goals. Now retired, Tom is intent and enthusiastic about helping a broader audience to financial prosperity. Financial independence is for everyone, and with the right outlook and strategy, nothing can stop you from living the life you desire. You can do this, too. It\u2019s no secret that financial success starts with a solid education, and I hope that you use this book as the ways and means of making the future brighter for yourself and your family. If you want to stop earning money for someone else, start doing the things you want, and to have a better quality of life, then this book will deliver. Scroll up and click the BUY NOW button.",

    "description": "This book is NOT: This is NOT a copy of The Intelligent Investor, Security Analysis, and the Wealth of Nations. Those books are huge (1,940 pages combined) and sometimes difficult to understand. This book is concise (200 pages), it explains the important information found in those books, and it has easy to understand video lessons that accompany every chapter. This is NOT a get rich quick book. The advice demonstrates how Warren Buffett truly thinks and how he accumulated billions over a lifetime - not 3 years. This book IS: Completely interactive with over 10 hours of video content. A guide for amateur and intermediate investors to finally understand the content found in The Intelligent Investor, Security Analysis, and the Wealth of Nations. Easy to understand, yet covers complex topics for stocks, bonds, and preferred shares. Did you know Warren Buffett, the world's wealthiest stock investor, is quoted as saying three books have shaped his investment philosophy? For more than half a century, he used the information provided in these three books to go from nothing - to a massive $39 billion net worth. The three books that gave him this wisdom are: The Wealth of Nations (pub. 1776) by Adam Smith, Security Analysis (pub. 1934) by Benjamin Graham, and The Intelligent Investor (pub. 1949), also by Benjamin Graham. In fact, Benjamin Graham was Buffett's professor at Columbia and the most influential financial advisor he ever had. So, have you ever tried reading Graham's books? Many might agree the books are as exciting as listening to Ben Stein read the 30th page of The Wall Street Journal. It is time we fixed that. Instead of keeping these billion-dollar secrets hidden behind thousands of pages of financial jargon, I wrote one simple guide - Warren Buffett's Three Favorite Books. If you're looking for a guide that explains how the wealthy really think and buy assets, you're in the right place. This isn't a get-rich-quick book. Instead, this is where your investing techniques take a turn in the road. This book will teach you how to accumulate assets and become very wealthy over decades of wise decisions and proper asset valuation. The best part about the book is the methods are taught in an easy-to-follow and understandable scenario for all to enjoy!",
