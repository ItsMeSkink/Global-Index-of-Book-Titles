    "description": "In the spirit of Steve Jobs and Moneyball , Elon Musk is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley's most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs - a real-life Tony Stark - and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new makers. Elon Musk spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his Internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius' life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: Can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk - one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history - is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists, including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.",

Non solo per un uomo ma anche per una squadra ben allenata di scienziati, imprenditori, costruttori e operai. Ma ce l'ha fatta. Il suo nome lo conoscete sicuramente. Elon Musk. \u00c8 gi\u00e0 diventato un meme, lo conoscono tutti. Tutti sanno pi\u00f9 o meno quello che fa. E quando lancia un nuovo missile nello spazio, lo seguono milioni di persone da tutto il mondo. Ma pochissimi di loro sanno: come \u00e8 nata l'idea di organizzare una colonia su Marte; da dove viene l'idea di SpaceX e cosa c'\u00e8 dentro a questo missile che lo rende cos\u00ec speciale; perch\u00e9 Tesla \u00e8 riuscita a costruire una macchina elettrica autonoma mentre le altre aziende hanno fallito in questa impresa; chi da i nomi alle macchine Tesla e chi ha creato il loro celebre design; chi \u00e8 responsabile per le porte di Tesla e altre idee a prima vista irrealizzabili e assurde, ma che poi risultano pratiche e rivoluzionarie; e, cosa non meno importante, quante ore al giorno dedica al lavoro Elon Musk per realizzare tutto quanto. Ashlee Vance, giornalista e scrittore tenace e appassionato, rivela molti dettagli interessanti della persona di Elon Musk, del suo stile di vita, delle sue idee, della sua visione del mondo. Possiamo dare un'occhiata al suo mondo ben organizzato e seguire con ammirazione (e i primi minuti anche con un po' di diffidenza, diciamoci la verit\u00e0) come le sue idee diventano realt\u00e0 e in seguito cambiano anche il nostro futuro.",

Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than 30 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity, and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies along the way. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.",

PREVIEW: Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future is a biography of tech developer and entrepreneur Elon Musk. Musk is famous as the CEO of Tesla, which makes electric car, and SpaceX, a private rocket developer. Musk was born in South Africa. His mother, Maye, was a model and his father, Errol, was an electrical engineer. Musk had a difficult childhood, and was often bullied in school. His parents divorced when he was nine and he and his brother, Kimbal, went to live with their father. Errol was a very unpleasant man, and treated the boys coldly and perhaps abusively. The trauma of his childhood may have affected Musk's need for validation, his obsessive work ethic, and his difficulty in communicating with others later in life.",

Costruire una macchina del futuro pratica, efficiente e pronta a conquistare il mondo con le sue linee eleganti? Non solo sognare ma camminare a grandi passi verso il lancio degli uomini su Marte? Inventare un'app e diventare un milionario prima di trent'anni? Sembra impossibile riuscire a fare tutto questo nel corso di una vita, vero? Non solo per un uomo ma anche per una squadra ben allenata di scienziati, imprenditori, costruttori e operai. Ma ce l'ha fatta. Il suo nome lo conoscete sicuramente. Elon Musk. \u00c8 gi\u00e0 diventato un meme, lo conoscono tutti. Tutti sanno pi\u00f9 o meno quello che fa. E quando lancia un nuovo missile nello spazio, lo seguono milioni di persone da tutto il mondo. Ma pochissimi di loro sanno: come \u00e8 nata l'idea di organizzare una colonia su Marte; da dove viene l'idea di SpaceX e cosa c'\u00e8 dentro a questo missile che lo rende cos\u00ec speciale; perch\u00e9 Tesla \u00e8 riuscita a costruire una macchina elettrica autonoma mentre le altre aziende hanno fallito in questa impresa; chi da i nomi alle macchine Tesla e chi ha creato il loro celebre design; chi \u00e8 responsabile per le porte di Tesla e altre idee a prima vista irrealizzabili e assurde, ma che poi risultano pratiche e rivoluzionarie; e, cosa non meno importante, quante ore al giorno dedica al lavoro Elon Musk per realizzare tutto quanto. Ashlee Vance, giornalista e scrittore tenace e appassionato, rivela molti dettagli interessanti della persona di Elon Musk, del suo stile di vita, delle sue idee, della sua visione del mondo. Possiamo dare un'occhiata al suo mondo ben organizzato e seguire con ammirazione (e i primi minuti anche con un po' di diffidenza, diciamoci la verit\u00e0) come le sue idee diventano realt\u00e0 e in seguito cambiano anche il nostro futuro.",

He grew up in a normal environment just like us but what makes him different is that he has always been fond of using and exploring the wonders of technology. He purchased his very first company when he was just 10 years old and with that, he decided to start programming. In fact, just two years after that, he was able to create Blastar, his very first game and made it available for purchase. He was 17 years old when he studied in Canada but then left 3 years later to study physics and business in Pennsylvania. He then studied at Stanford University and took up Ph. D in energy physics. The time he moved was about the same time when the Internet had been garnering much attention and because of that, he dropped out of school to pursue his dreams. Continue reading to learn more...

    "description": "A momentous look at the private companies driving a revolutionary new economy in space, from the New York Times bestselling author of Elon Musk With the launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2008, Elon Musk's SpaceX became the first private company to build a low-cost rocket that could reach orbit. And that milestone carried major implications: Silicon Valley, not NASA or nation states, was suddenly cemented as the epicenter of the new Space Age. Start-ups and the wealthy investors behind them began to realize that the universe\u2014ungoverned and infinite\u2014was open for business. Welcome to the Wild West of aerospace engineering. When the Heavens Went on Sale tells the remarkable, unfolding story of this frenzied intergalactic land grab. Through his trademark immersive reporting, Ashlee Vance follows four pioneering companies\u2014Astra, Firefly, Planet Labs, and Rocket Lab\u2014as they build new space systems and attempt to launch rockets and satellites into orbit by the thousands. While the public fixated on the space tourism being driven by the likes of Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson, these new companies arrived with a different set of goals: to make rocket and satellite launches fast and cheap, thereby opening Earth's lower orbit for business\u2014and setting it up as the next playing field for humankind's technological evolution, where we can connect, analyze, and monitor everything on Earth. Vance has had a front-row seat and singular access to this peculiar and unprecedented moment in history. When the Heavens Went on Sale travels through private company headquarters, labs, and top-secret launch locations around the world, including California, Texas, Alaska, New Zealand, Ukraine, India, and French Guiana. He chronicles it all in full color: the private jets, communes, gun-toting bodyguards, drugs, espionage investigations, and multimillionaires guzzling booze to dull the pain as their fortunes disappear. With the most detailed and intimate reporting of Vance's career, When the Heavens Went on Sale reveals the spectacular chaos of the new business of space, and what happens when the idealistic, ambitious minds of Silicon Valley turn their unbridled vision toward the limitless expanse of the stars. This is the most pressing and controversial technology story of our time, a tale of fascinating characters chasing unimaginable stakes as they race to space.",

    "description": "***SPANISH EDITION*** New York Times and International Bestseller Named One of the Best Books of the Year by The Wall Street Journal, NPR, Audible and Amazon More than 1 million copies sold In the spirit of Steve Jobs and Moneyball, Elon Musk is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley's most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs--a real-life Tony Stark--and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new \"makers.\" Elon Musk spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his Internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy. Thorough and insightful, Elon Musk brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans.",

    "description": "Just Who Is Elon Musk & How Has He Managed To Achieve So Much In His Relatively Short Life? - NOW INCLUDES FREE GIFTS! (See below for details) When actor Robert Downey Jr. signed on to portray Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man), he suggested to director John Favreau that they meet up with Elon Musk. They have a task of bringing to life a superhero, and Musk is the closest there ever is to Marvel\u2019s genius, billionaire, philanthropist in real life. The meeting was set and some of Musk\u2019s characteristics went into RDJ\u2019s portrayal of Tony Stark on screen, thus creating the memorable character that people come to know and love. In reality, there is far more to Musk\u2019s life and person than can be personified by a fictional character. Sure, he does have a lot in common with Iron Man; he\u2019s a prodigious tech genius and entrepreneur, with the capacity to make seemingly impossible ideas a reality. Like Tony Stark, he dreams, thinks and lives large, but that is where the similarity ends. Unlike his comic book counterpart, Elon Musk was not born into a life of luxury and ease. Despite showing potential for greatness as early as his preteens, his childhood and young adult life was filled with adversaries. To this day, Musk credits his early life struggles in helping him cultivate the indomitable spirit he is known for. In this book, we will look at Elon\u2019s story and find out exactly how he has gone from a young man raised in Pretoria, South Africa to become a truly one of a kind businessman and genius-visionary who\u2019s boundaries are seemingly unlimited. In this book you\u2019ll learn about: The Beginnings Of Elon\u2019s Greatness How Elon\u2019s Young Promise Was Fulfilled Elon\u2019s Path From X.com To PayPal The Remarkable Story Of Tesla Motors Space X - Elon\u2019s Otherworldly Ambitions! The Success Of SolarCity Elon\u2019s Plan Of Revolutionizing Mass Transit Via Hyperloop And as a bonus, I\u2019ve also included a FREE BOOK and other great surprises! You will see that from relatively humble beginnings Elon has been able to make the seemingly impossible a reality. His remarkable and motivational story illustrates that with a vision, drive and determination, we really are able to achieve anything we set out minds to.

PREVIEW: Ashlee Vance's Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX and the Quest for a Fantastic Future is a biography of tech developer and entrepreneur Elon Musk. Musk is famous as the CEO of Tesla, which makes electric car, and SpaceX, a private rocket developer. Musk was born in South Africa. His mother, Maye, was a model and his father, Errol, was an electrical engineer. Musk had a difficult childhood, and was often bullied in school. His parents divorced when he was nine and he and his brother, Kimbal, went to live with their father. Errol was a very unpleasant man, and treated the boys coldly and perhaps abusively. The trauma of his childhood may have affected Musk's need for validation, his obsessive work ethic, and his difficulty in communicating with others later in life.",

Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family and friends, the book traces the entrepreneur's journey from a rough upbringing in South Africa to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than 30 hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to 300 people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies: PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX and SolarCity, and to characterize a man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation while making plenty of enemies along the way. Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our time: can the nation of inventors and creators which led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.",

Born at the start of the millennium, it was the first car company to be valued at $1 trillion. Its CEO, the mercurial, charismatic Elon Musk has become not just a celebrity but the richest man in the world. But Tesla\u2019s success was far from guaranteed. Founded in the 2000s, the company was built on an audacious vision. Musk and a small band of Silicon Valley engineers set out to make a car that was quicker, sexier, smoother, and cleaner than any gas-guzzler on the road. Tesla would undergo a hellish fifteen years, beset by rivals\u2014pressured by investors, hobbled by whistleblowers. Musk often found himself in the public\u2019s crosshairs, threatening to bring down the company he had helped build. Wall Street Journal tech and auto reporter Tim Higgins had a front-row seat for the drama: the pileups, breakdowns, and the unlikeliest outcome of all, success. A story of impossible wagers and unlikely triumphs, Power Play is an exhilarating look at how a team of innovators beat the odds\u2014and changed the future.",

Inside this detailed account of Elon Musk\u2019s life and career, you\u2019ll learn about his childhood and schooling in South Africa, his humble beginnings on the American continent, and his first endeavours into business. From the early Zip2 and X.com which marked the beginnings of Musk\u2019s career, to the cutting-edge SpaceX and Tesla we know him for today, you\u2019ll discover how an obscure and unassuming idea led to the founding of SpaceX, how Tesla revolutionized electric cars, and how these companies (and Musk himself) continue to endure against all odds. But beyond the business, you\u2019ll also have a chance to get a glimpse of the man himself \u2013 Musk\u2019s polarizing public image, his countless hijinks, and famous sensations like the Not-A-Flamethrower and the media-rating site Pravduh . From Musk\u2019s political and religious views to his appearance in key internet subcultures, Elon Musk: The Biography of a Modern Genius and Business Titan gives a unique and powerful insight into one of the world\u2019s most famous men.",
