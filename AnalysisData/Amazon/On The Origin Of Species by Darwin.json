Possibly the most important and challenging scientific book ever published, Darwin's language remains surprisingly modern and direct. It is presented here in a faithful yet generously detailed facsimile edition. The text is taken from the second edition (1860), which incorporated some minor corrections but is otherwise the purest distillation of Darwin's original vision. It includes a new foreword as well as an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin, taken from the third edition (1861).",

The seminal work went on to form the foundation of the modern understanding of biology and natural science. First published in 1859, On the Origin of Species presents Darwin's scientific study of the process of natural selection. Illustrating his evolutionary theory and the interrelatedness of heritable variation and the evolution of humans, animals and plant life. Darwin wrote for non-specialist readers, aiding the book in reaching a wide audience. By the 1870s, Darwin's theory of evolution was commonly regarded as fact within the scientific community. The book includes his own sketches of evolution to support his theory, as well as abstracts of his experiments and research. The chapters in this volume include: - 'Variation Under Domestication' - 'Variation Under Nature' - 'Struggle for Existence' - 'Natural Selection' - 'Laws of Variation' Preserving a key scientific text for future generations, On the Origin of Species has been proudly republished by Read & Co. Books, featuring a specially commissioned biography of the author. An essential read for those with an interest in the groundbreaking work of Charles Darwin and the study of the history of evolution.",

The Origin of Species was the first mature and persuasive work to explain how species change through the process of natural selection. Upon its publication, the book began to transform attitudes about society and religion, and was soon used to justify the philosophies of communists, socialists, capitalists, and even Germany's National Socialists. But the most quoted response came from Thomas Henry Huxley, Darwin's friend and also a renowned naturalist, who exclaimed, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!\"",

    "description": "It is now generally recognized that the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 not only decisively altered the basic concepts of biological theory but had a profound and lasting influence on social, philosophic, and religious thought. This work is rightly regarded as one of the most important books ever printed. The first edition had a freshness and uncompromising directness that were considerably weakened in subsequent editions. Nearly all reprints were based on the greatly modified sixth edition (1872), and the only modern reprint changes pagination, making references to the original very difficult. Clearly, there has been a need for a facsimile reprint. Professor Mayr's introduction has a threefold purpose: to list passages in the first edition that Darwin altered in later editions; to point out instances in which Darwin was clearly pioneering; and to call attention to neglected passages that show Darwin as a much deeper thinker than has been recognized. No one can fail to be impressed by the originality of Darwin's treatment and by the intellectual challenge his work presents even to the modern reader.",

Possibly the most important and challenging scientific book ever published, Darwin's language remains surprisingly modern and direct. It is presented here in a faithful yet generously detailed facsimile edition. The text is taken from the second edition (1860), which incorporated some minor corrections but is otherwise the purest distillation of Darwin's original vision. It includes a new foreword as well as an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin, taken from the third edition (1861).",

    "description": "A \u201cclassic science book\u201d written in bygone days, with a sophistication today\u2019s \u201cscientific studies\u201d lack. On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is an example of classic non-fiction first published in 1859 in the United Kingdom. A true book of value, a classic that continues to live on across the ages. Books from yesteryear have an artistic quality and a permanence often lacking in books from the modern era. You are sure to love this work. A work of science of the finest type. A Glimpse Inside If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs. In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. Synopsis On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin was first published in 1859 (and this edition is a reproduction of the text of that original edition) and is still one of the most important scientific books of all time. The evolutionary theory usually boiled down to the phrase 'the survival of the fittest' has not been seriously challenged down to the present day. The theory espoused here is that living organisms evolve over a long period of time, generation by generation, through a process of natural selection - any adaptations that prove favorable to the survival of the species get passed on to future generations and those that don't eventually die out. This really is a book that all of us should read at least once in our lives. \"A beautiful reprint\" from Wombrook Publishing. We have taken every step possible to ensure the original quality of this book has been maintained to the best standard. This means that the text in this edition is unedited and unchanged from the author\u2019s original publication, preserving its earliest form for your enjoyment. This book is one of the best scientific treatise of all time. Its words are arranged with such literary precision, in a way that is just not seen in science writing from today. This title will make a brilliant gift for the classic scientific literature lover in your life, or a magnificent addition to your current book collection. We are ready to post this book off to you today with all due haste , so that you can indulge in this title without delay.

'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species\u2014that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.",

    "description": "A new, deluxe hardcover edition of one of the most important scientific works ever written In December 1831, Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle , accompanying her crew on a five-year journey that crossed the Atlantic Ocean to survey the coasts of South America. As the expedition\u2019s geologist and naturalist, Darwin collected evidence from the Galapagos Islands and other locations which prompted him to speculate that species evolve over generations through a process of natural selection. In 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. His revolutionary work presented evidence from the Beagle expedition as well as from years of subsequent research and experimentation. Written for non-specialists, Darwin\u2019s book gained widespread interest from the scientific community, religious leaders, politicians and the general public. The theory Darwin presented in his book quickly became the subject of heated debate and discussion. Now accepted by the scientific community, Darwin\u2019s concepts of evolutionary adaptation via natural selection are central to modern evolutionary theory and form the foundation of modern life sciences. Perhaps the most transformative scientific volume ever published, this volume of the first edition of On the Origin of Species : Outlines Darwin\u2019s ideas, scientific influences and the core of his theory Details natural selection and address possible objections to the theory Examines the fossil record and biogeography to support evolutionary adaptation Features a \"Recapitulation and Conclusion\" which reviews key concepts and considers the future relevance of Darwin\u2019s theory On the Origin of Species: The Science Classic is an important addition to the bestselling Capstone Classics series edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon. It includes an insightful Introduction from leading Darwin scholar Dr John van Wyhe of the University of Singapore, which presents new research and an offers an original perspective on Darwin and his famous work. This high-quality, hardcover volume is a must-have for readers interested in science and scientific literature, particularly evolutionary theory and life sciences.",

The book will endure in future ages so long as a knowledge of science persists among mankind.\" \u2014 Nature It took Charles Darwin more than twenty years to publish this book, in part because he realized that it would ignite a firestorm of controversy. On the Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world. In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory.

However, many favoured competing explanations, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution.[11][12] Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.[13][14]Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the University of Edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. Studies at the University of Cambridge (Christ's College) encouraged his passion for natural science.[15] His five-year voyage on HMS Beagle established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported Charles Lyell's conception of gradual geological change, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.[16]Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection.[17] Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority.[18] He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories.[19] Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature.[11] In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.",

Darwin\u2019s reasoned, documented arguments carefully advance his theory of natural selection and his assertion that species were not created all at once by a divine hand but started with a few simple forms that mutated and adapted over time. Whether commenting on his own poor health, discussing his experiments to test instinct in bees, or relating a conversation about a South American burrowing rodent, Darwin\u2019s monumental achievement is surprisingly personal and delightfully readable. Its profound ideas remain controversial even today, making it the most influential book in the natural sciences ever written\u2014an important work not just to its time but to the history of humankind.",

    "description": "This is the first and original edition of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published on November 24, 1859 in London by John Murray. It is a seminal work in scientific literature and a landmark work in evolutionary biology. It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution.The starting chapters introduce the theory of natural selection, explaining why certain species thrive, while others decrease in number, how the members of nature are in competition with each other and why organisms tend to vary and change with time. Much of this work is based on experiments and observations seen within domestic animals and plants.The later chapters defend the theory of natural selection against apparent inconsistencies, why geological records are incomplete, why we find species so widespread and how sterility can be inherited when the organisation is unable to reproduce and more.The book is approachable for any audience.",

Get to grips with the essential points of Darwin's theory of evolution in next to no time with this concise guide. 50Minutes.com provides a clear and engaging analysis of Darwin's theory of evolution. After setting sail aboard the Beagle to carry out a scientific expedition, Charles Darwin made some surprising discoveries: using the example of finches on the Galapagos Islands, he concluded that each of the 13 species he found must have evolved from one common ancestor and adapted to best suit their environment. This led to him developing his theory of evolution and identifying natural selection as the cause, both of which are explained in his world-famous On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. In just 50 minutes you will: - Understand the context in which Darwin published his theory and the source of the many controversies surrounding it - Learn more about Darwin's life and career and how it led him to his astounding discovery - Analyse the progression of Darwin's work, including his travels, discoveries and the final publication of his theory after 20 years of development ABOUT 50MINUTES.COM History & Culture 50MINUTES.COM will enable you to quickly understand the main events, people, conflicts and discoveries from world history that have shaped the world we live in today.

    "description": "In 1859, an amateur British naturalist published a book of findings that shook the scientific community to its core and changed the structure of religion and science as we know them. The product of over 20 years of research, The Origin of Species challenged the popular belief that species could not evolve and argued that species can adapt to their environment and develop accordingly. Although other scientists had observed some of the phenomena that Charles Darwin addressed, he was the first to theorize that natural selection, and later, evolution, were viable explanations for the origins of life. The implications of Darwin's findings still reverberate today, in the classroom, in the courtroom, and at the highest legislative levels. Lively thematic chapters explore how Darwin came to the conclusions published in The Origin of Species \u2015and in later works such as The Descent of Man \u2015from his early years at Cambridge, to his observations of species on the HMS Beagle voyages, through the 20 years of research that culminated in Origin . Also included is an insightful discussion of Darwin's impact as it is felt today, from movies and popular culture to the current Intelligent Design controversy. Biographies of influential figures, primary source letters and selections from Origin , a glossary of terms, and an extensive annotated bibliography round out this accessible work.",

Darwin's greatness, however, has obscured the man and his work, at times even to the point of distortion. Accessibly written, this book presents a more nuanced picture and invites us to discover some neglected ambiguities and contradictions in Darwin's masterwork. Delisle and Tierney show Darwin to be a man who struggled to reconcile the received wisdom of an unchanging natural world with his new ideas about evolution. Arguing that Darwin was unable to break free entirely from his contemporaries' more traditional outlook, they show his theory to be a fascinating compromise between old and new. Rediscovering this other Darwin \u2013 and this other side of On the Origin of Species \u2013 helps shed new light on the immensity of the task that lay before 19th century scholars, as well as their ultimate achievements.",

    "description": "Most people attribute evolutionary theory to Charles Darwin. In truth, he shares this honor with Alfred Russel Wallace. Darwin had been laboring over his ideas for two decades, and was not completed when he was forced to reveal his work early so as not to be outmatched by Wallace. Although intending to compile a more substantial volume, his colleagues encouraged him to publish a shorter version quickly: the first edition of \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. Few readers realize that the version of \"Origin of Species\" commonly seen in bookstores and schools is the sixth edition. Darwin made many alterations to his book over 14 years, mostly to quell criticisms raised by peers. However, academics do not agree on whether these accumulated changes actually adulterated Darwin\u2019s original view on the evolutionary process. Did Darwin dilute the importance of natural selection in later editions? Did he waffle on the Earth\u2019s age and, consequently, the time available for adaptive changes to occur? Did he fall back on old Lamarckian paradigms, such as importance of use and disuse, to counter recrimination? No doubt, to truly understand Darwin\u2019s initial insight into his theory of evolution, one must read this first edition of \"On the Origin of Species,\" which is available as the sixth entry in the Foundations in Biological Thought series. This series presents the pivotal works of 19th century naturalists remastered for modern readers. Meticulously edited, these volumes preserve the author's intent in design and content, including the manuscript's original annotations and amendments. In addition, revised page references and editor's notes are included throughout to retain the utility of the works for both study and reference.",

Synopsis In 1859, British biologist Charles Darwin released his revolutionary scientific treatise 'On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection' in England. In Darwin's hypothesis, a process he named \"natural selection\" is responsible for the steady evolution of life. A species' general genetic makeup is influenced by natural selection, where animals with genetic variations that are better suited to their environment tend to have more offspring than organisms of the same species that lack the variation. For the most of human history, the general consensus was that the universe was formed in a single instant. That was until scientists began to question it, and Charles Darwin's book revolutionised our understanding of the process of evolution.

The seminal work went on to form the foundation of the modern understanding of biology and natural science. First published in 1859, On the Origin of Species presents Darwin's scientific study of the process of natural selection. Illustrating his evolutionary theory and the interrelatedness of heritable variation and the evolution of humans, animals and plant life. Darwin wrote for non-specialist readers, aiding the book in reaching a wide audience. By the 1870s, Darwin's theory of evolution was commonly regarded as fact within the scientific community. The book includes his own sketches of evolution to support his theory, as well as abstracts of his experiments and research. The chapters in this volume include: - 'Variation Under Domestication' - 'Variation Under Nature' - 'Struggle for Existence' - 'Natural Selection' - 'Laws of Variation' Preserving a key scientific text for future generations, On the Origin of Species has been proudly republished by Read & Co.

Inspired by evidence that he collected during his expedition on the \u2018HMS Beagle\u2019 and his research regarding selective breeding, Darwin theorized that all species descended from a common ancestor. In his groundbreaking work of evolutionary biology, \u201cOn the Origin of Species,\u201d he details the scientific theory of evolution, which posits that species evolve over a period of many generations through a process of natural selection. Considered controversial even to this day because of its contradicting position to creationist theory, Darwin's theories have been widely embraced by the scientific community as fact. Darwin\u2019s discoveries laid the foundation for a unifying theory of life sciences which explains the rich diversity in the natural world and would lead to other major important advancements in the field of biology and related fields. \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d is arguably one of the most important scientific treatises ever written. This edition includes a brief introduction by Charles W. Eliot and is printed on premium acid-free paper.",

    "description": "On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, is widely accepted as the seminal work in modern biology. Through careful observation, Charles Darwin explains how traits can be selected for within a population. This is easily observed in the artificial selection of farm animals, for instance. Darwin's theory caused an uproar that can still be heard today by refuting the Christian doctrine of created breeds, in which all species that exist now have always existed just as they are. It is the very publication of this work that gave Charles Darwin his place of prominence in the history of the theory of evolution, because while he was not the first to suggest such a mechanism, his book and its exhaustive studies made the information widely available. English scientist, naturalist, and geologist CHARLES DARWIN (1809-1882) revolutionized science, especially biology, with his theory of evolution through natural selection. As a passenger aboard the Beagle, Darwin became intrigued by the existence of different species in different geographical locations, which aided in the development of his theory. In addition to The Origin of Species, he is also remembered for The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals.",

For the next five years, he conducted research on plants and animals from around the globe, amassing a body of evidence that would culminate in one of the greatest discoveries in the history of mankind-the theory of evolution. Darwin presented his stunning insights in a landmark book that forever altered the way human beings view themselves and the world they live in. In The Origin of Species, Darwin convincingly demonstrates the fact of evolution: that existing animals and plants cannot have appeared separately but must have slowly transformed from ancestral creatures. Most important, the book fully explains the mechanism that effects such a transformation: natural selection, the idea that made evolution scientifically intelligible for the first time. One of the few revolutionary works of science that is readily accessible to the nonscientist, The Origin of Species not only launched the science of modern biology but has also influenced virtually all subsequent literary, philosophical, and religious thinking.",

A sensation on its publication in 1859, The Origin of the Species profoundly shocked Victorian readers by calling into question the belief in a Creator with its description of evolution through natural selection. And Darwin\u2019s seminal work is nearly as controversial today. In her illuminating study, Browne delves into the long genesis of Darwin\u2019s theories, from his readings as a university student and his five-year voyage on the Beagle , to his debates with contemporaries and experiments in his garden. She explores the shock to Darwin when he read of competing scientist\u2019s similar discoveries and the wide and immediate impact of Darwin\u2019s theories on the world. As one of the launch titles in Atlantic Monthly Press\u2019 \u0093Books That Changed the World\u201d series, Browne\u2019s history takes readers inside The Origin of the Species and shows why it can fairly claim to be the greatest science book ever published.",

    "description": "Charles Darwin is often credited with discovering evolution through natural selection, but the idea was not his alone. The naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, working independently, saw the same process at work in the natural world and elaborated much the same theory. Their important scientific contributions made both men famous in their lifetimes, but Wallace slipped into obscurity after his death, while Darwin's renown grew. Dispelling the misperceptions that continue to paint Wallace as a secondary figure, James Costa reveals the two naturalists as true equals in advancing one of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time. Analyzing Wallace's \"Species Notebook,\" Costa shows how Wallace's methods and thought processes paralleled Darwin's, yet inspired insights uniquely his own. Kept during his Southeast Asian expeditions of the 1850s, the notebook is a window into Wallace's early evolutionary ideas. It records his evidence-gathering, critiques of anti-evolutionary arguments, and plans for a book on \"transmutation.\" Most important, it demonstrates conclusively that natural selection was not some idea Wallace stumbled upon, as is sometimes assumed, but was the culmination of a decade-long quest to solve the mystery of the origin of species. Wallace, Darwin, and the Origin of Species also reexamines the pivotal episode in 1858 when Wallace sent Darwin a manuscript announcing his discovery of natural selection, prompting a joint public reading of the two men's papers on the subject. Costa's analysis of the \"Species Notebook\" shines a new light on these readings, further illuminating the independent nature of Wallace's discoveries.",

    "description": "The full title of the first edition was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life - The origin of species through natural selection, or the preservation of favored breeds in the struggle for life. In its sixth edition of 1872, the short title was modified to The Origin of Species -The Origin of Species-. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process known as natural selection. He presented evidence that the diversity of life emerged from common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included the evidence he gathered in his expedition on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and his subsequent discoveries through research, correspondence and experimentation. Several evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain the new discoveries of biology. There was increasing support for these ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but during the first half of the nineteenth century the English scientific community was closely linked to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology . Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial, since they conflicted with beliefs that species were an immutable part of a designed hierarchy and that human beings were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were debated intensely, but the transmutation was not accepted by the scientific current. The book was written for non-specialized readers, and aroused great interest from its publication. As Darwin was an eminent scientist, his conclusions were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated a scientific, philosophical and religious debate. The debate on the book contributed to the campaign of Thomas Huxley and his colleagues at the X Club to secularize science, promoting scientific naturalism. In two decades there was a general scientific agreement that evolution had taken place, with a ramified pattern of common descent, but scientists were slow to give natural selection the importance that Darwin believed was desirable. During the \"eclipse of Darwinism\" from 1880 to the 1930s, other mechanisms of evolution were given more importance. With the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s, Darwin's concept of evolutionary adaptation by natural selection became fundamental to the modern theory of evolution, now the unifying concept of the life sciences.",

    "description": "Here is the revised edition of Charles Dawrin's The Origin of Species , introduced and abridged by Philip Appleman, published by W. W. Norton. As much as anyone in the modern era, Charles Darwin changed the course of human thought. The impact on Western civilization of his seminal work has been broad and deep: not only the biological sciences but also social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature have all been shaped and reshaped by evolutionary concepts. Here, in what Paul Moody (writing in Victorian Studies ) has called \"a masterly condensation,\" is a classic edition of Darwin's The Origin of Species . It retains all of the substance of the original book, but only the essential elements of its profuse detail. Philip Appleman, the editor of Darwin , a Norton Critical Edition (\"the best Darwin anthology on the market,\" according to Stephen Jay Gould), has cut deftly to the essence of Darwin's classic, losing none of the continuity or flavor of the original and making available an edition that modern readers will not find overpowering. This revision includes a new introduction by Professor Appleman that perceptively traces Darwin's influence on the world of ideas as well as three additional chapters from Darwin's work.",

When on board H.M.S.

These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species\u2014that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.",

It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. The starting chapters introduce the theory of natural selection, explaining why certain species thrive, while others decrease in number, how the members of nature are in competition with each other and why organisms tend to vary and change with time. Much of this work is based on experiments and observations seen within domestic animals and plants. The later chapters defend the theory of natural selection against apparent inconsistencies, why geological records are incomplete, why we find species so widespread and how sterility can be inherited when the organisation is unable to reproduce and more.

His experiences, observations and reflections during and after his pivotal journey on the Beagle during 1831\u201336 were of critical importance. Darwin was not, however, a man to be rushed. While his autobiography claims that the framework of his theory was laid down by 1839, its first outline sketch did not emerge until 1842. That essay was heavily edited, with many insertions and erasures. It formed the vital kernel of his more expansive but also unpolished and unpublished essay of 1844. Following careful editing by his son Francis, both essays were published in 1909, and are reproduced here. Reading these side by side, and together with the Origin, permits us to scrutinise selection and evolution truly in action.",

    "description": "Implications of Darwin's theory of evolution for today's religious belief and scientific study 2009 marks the 150th anniversary of the first edition of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species by Natural Selection . Upon the publication of the first edition of Charles Darwin's work, science woke up to startling possibilities and religion woke up to a frightening challenge to its very existence. Because of Darwin's book, petulant scientists rewrote history to depict an ongoing \"warfare\" between science and religion, representing themselves as the victors. Religious leaders fought and continue to fight back. Within the world of scientific research, Darwin's theory of evolution did win. Although itself modified and adapted, evolution's basic principles of natural selection and variation in inheritance remain firmly in place. However, the implications for religious belief are still being sorted. Beginning in the late 19th century, a vigorous brand of atheism has used Darwin's model as ammunition in its attack of religious faith. Theologians and church leaders have had to clear away the debris of Social Darwinism, Eugenics, and Atheistic Materialism. Yet, the question remains, does Darwin's theory undermine religion? In order to get at a precise assessment, we need to distinguish the essential science of Darwin from ideological overlays. Dr. Hewlett will review the scientific milieu in which Darwin wrote, the scientific acceptance of the work and its continued importance and fruitfulness. He will also address the philosophical implications of the theory that continue to reverberate. Dr. Peters will give an overview of the conflict between the various interpreters of Darwin that culminates in today's versions of Creationism, Intelligent Design, Theistic Evolution, Social Darwinism, Eugenics, and Atheistic Materialism. He will also highlight theological implications of Darwin's text. The CD-ROM will contain the complete text of the 6th edition of Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species by Natural Selection .",

    "description": "If Darwin were to examine the evidence today using modern science, would his conclusions be the same? Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, published over 150 years ago, is considered one of history's most influential books and continues to serve as the foundation of thought for evolutionary biology. Since Darwin's time, however, new fields of science have emerged that simply give us better answers to the question of origins. With a Ph.D. in cell and developmental biology from Harvard University, Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson is uniquely qualified to investigate what genetics reveal about origins. The Origins Puzzle Comes Together If the science surrounding origins were a puzzle, Darwin would have had fewer than 15% of the pieces to work with when he developed his theory of evolution. We now have a much greater percentage of the pieces because of modern scientific research. As Dr. Jeanson puts the new pieces together, a whole new picture emerges, giving us a testable, predictive model to explain the origin of species. A New Scientific Revolution Begins So what comes next? Darwin's theory of evolution may be one of science's longest standing, but the latest genetics research is casting doubt on it. Are these new discoveries cause to critically reexamine Darwin's theory? Replacing Darwin asks you to give serious consideration to modern scientific advances and reevaluate the problems that have surfaced in Darwin's theory of evolution.\"",

His concept of natural selection has created eruptive disputes among scientists and religious leaders of his time and ours. The phenomenal importance of his brilliant work is universally recognized, but the present volume marks the first scholarly attempt to compile a complete variorum edition of The Origin of Species , covering all of the extensive variants in the six texts published between 1859 and 1872. Darwin's changes were extensive. His book grew by a third as he rewrote many passages four or five times, and in this edition Morse Peckham has recorded every one of those changes. A book of such distinctive dimensions, on a subject of such profound importance, will be of intense interest to historians of biology, evolution, science, literature, and cultural development. It will be an invaluable aid to the clarification and full comprehension of this complex and renowned scientific classic.",

On the Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world. In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory.",

    "description": "Charles Darwin called on a broad and unusually powerful combination of critical thinking skills to create his wide-ranging explanation for biological change, On the Origin of Species. It\u2019s one of those rare books that takes a huge problem \u2013 the enormous diversity of different species \u2013 and seeks to use a vast range of evidence to solve it. But it was perhaps Darwin\u2019s towering creative prowess that made the most telling contribution to this masterpiece, for it was this that enabled him to make the necessary fresh connections between so much disparate evidence from such a diversity of fields. All of Darwin\u2019s critical thinking skills were required, however, in the course of the decades of work that went into this volume. Taken as a whole, Darwin\u2019s solution to the problem that he set himself is carefully researched, considers multiple explanations, and justifies its conclusions with well-organised reasoning. At the time of the publication, in 1859, there were various explanations for the changes that Darwin \u2013 and others \u2013 observed; what separated Darwin from so many of his contemporaries is that he deployed critical thinking to arrive at a significantly new way of fitting explanation to evidence; one that remains elegant, complete and predictive to this day.",

Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. In the 1872 sixth edition \"On\" was omitted, so the full title is The origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.

'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species\u2014that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision. My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work\u2014the latter having read my sketch of 1844\u2014honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts. This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements; and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone.",
