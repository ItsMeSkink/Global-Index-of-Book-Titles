    "description": "The inspiring sequel to Wings of Fire. Over 3 lakh copies sold.'It was like any other day on the Anna University campus in Chennai. As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.'Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

    "description": "Dr Kalam, who was India's 11th president and has been a scientist and a teacher, has written more than 20 books. Ranging from inspirational and spiritual thoughts, to autobiographical reflections, to his vision statements for a developed India, these works bear the imprint of a mind that is deeply reflective. For the first time, some of the most thoughtful, inspiring and educative of these writings have been compiled in one place in The Righteous Life . Some of the essays in this volume describe his early life, family and teachers, and his entry into the world of scientific development and research. Also included are his thoughts on education, governance, probity in public life, and his analysis and solutions to some of India's problems, such as corruption, energy independence and the overall development of the country. Filled with wisdom and farsighted thinking that upholds honesty, diligence and spirituality, The Righteous Life showcases the working of one of the finest minds in the country.",

Dr. Kalam, who was India's eleventh President and has been a scientist and a teacher, has written more than twenty books. Ranging from inspirational and spiritual thoughts, to autobiographical reflections to his vision statements for a developed India, these works bear the imprint of a mind that is deeply reflective. For the first time, some of the most thoughtful, inspiring and educative of these writings have been compiled in one place in The Righteous Life. Some of the essays in this volume describe his early life, family and teachers and his entry into the world of scientific development and research. Also included are his thoughts on education, governance, probity in public life and his analysis and solutions to some of India's problems such as corruption, energy independence and the overall development of the country. Filled with wisdom and farsighted thinking that upholds honesty, diligence and spirituality, the Righteous Life showcases the working of one of the finest minds in the country.",

He met over 21 million children and young people in India and outside and spoke to them about the power of knowledge, ambition, moral behaviour and the need to bring about change in society. He travelled to almost every corner of the country meeting the youth in schools, universities and institutions and interacted with them like a committed teacher. In Learning How to Fly , some of his nearly 2,000 lectures have been compiled. These lectures were addressed to teachers and students in school and beyond. In each one of them he has spoken about preparing oneself best for life, to identify and overcome challenges and how to bring out the best within each individual. Through stories from his own life, those of his teachers and mentors as well as stories of some of the greatest men and women of the world, and the latest developments in science and technology, he shows us the importance of dreams and the hard work needed to turn those dreams into reality. Filled with warmth, inspiration and a positive attitude, Learning How to Fly is essential listening for every Indian, young and old.",

This book draws an unforgettable blue print of success for all. One lesson that shimmers from every page of this book is hope. Whether in failure or in success, there is always a clear vision of future. In human life as well as in the corporate world, the value of vision, leading to planning, followed by action should not be underestimated. The success smiles on those who dream and act. A message of spirituality, honesty, being unselfish and the value of giving emerges from these pages as from his life. The world has changed and there is a need for awakening together the head and the heart. While poems touch the heart and leave a deep impression, his prose leads you to think how to go beyond the rock walls of conditioning, perceptions and prejudices to achieve success and fulfilment. Clearly presented thoughts, in You Are Unique, become our inspiration and constant companion, flashing 'upon the inward eye' at our decision making, vision creating as well as ordinary moments of life. Visually appealing, illuminating, dotted with his simple and charming experiences of life, you will love to read this book again and again.",

Dr. Kalam by narrating his life journey evokes the reader to identify with one\u2019s inner fire and potential, for he was of the firm belief that each one of us was born with the strength and potential to make a tangible change in the world. How he inspired himself to achieve dreams and how he went about accomplishing so much is what the book captures nicely. The book recollects many anecdotes and stories from childhood, his time at school and college. The time spent at the Langley Research Center, NASA and Wallops Flight Facility gets a lot of attention. Personal tragedies have not been left out. The time when he lost his father and how he felt when conferred with many awards like the Padma Bhushan have been written in much detail. The second half of the book deals with Dr Kalam, the scientist who made a significant contribution in developing the countries guided missile program, a pioneering effort for the security of the nation. It's not with reason that he was nicknamed as the 'Missile Man of India'. The book also contains 24 photographs at various stages of his life.

Kalanidhi, fell in step with me.Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room.When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

Arun Tiwari tells Dr Kalam's life story with a deep understanding of his formative experiences and character and reveals him as a man personifying all the glory and paradoxes of his nation: secular and religious; exalted and humble; schooled and unaffected; dynamic and calm; scientific and spiritual - an Indian above all.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

And somewhere along the way, as I met a million children across this land, I too learnt from a million minds. This book was not written to only tell my story. I want every young reader to think that this book is his or her story too.' A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has been one of the most iconic figures of Independent India. A scientist, leader, thinker, teacher and writer, he achieved remarkable success in various fields. Yet, what endeared him to so many was his dedication to the idea of a developed India, his simple and direct way of interacting with people and his deep love for his fellowmen. In My Life, Kalam writes his life story starting from his days growing up at Rameswaram; about working on India's space and missile programmes; his years as the eleventh President of India; and about his life thereafter. Full of anecdotes that demonstrate the importance of hard work, commitment, courage and innovative thinking, this autobiography is a wonderful introduction to a remarkable life. Beautifully illustrated and simply written. My Life will inspire readers of all ages.",

What is it that we as a nation require to make that last-mile journey to what all the plans, investments and projects are meant to lead up to? It is only a matter of time before India is termed economically developed. But a nation has to learn to survive in tough times too. And for that what is most important is national character, born out of the value systems that exist in our families, what schools teach students, and the culture of the nation. In Pathways to Greatness, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam shifts focus from the economic development of India by 2020 to the development of our strengths, offering key lessons that will help India withstand the forces of change. He identifies what makes a nation great and also compares the standards of living of other nations with India's. He draws on his travels and his interactions with people. He evolves unique oaths for citizens from all walks of life to ensure that a better life becomes possible for everyone.In the book he completed just a few months before he passed away in 2015, one of India's best-known icons writes how our nation can become a leader on the pathways to greatness.",

    "description": "This book is an account of how Dr. Kalam visualizes Information and Communication Technology mining the rural talent. Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India at 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world. He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation. This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning. The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom. He advocates creation of conditions that favour growth of diverse individual talents akin to a garden and calls for a scientific mind-set guided by conscience, consensus and by actions that take our social and moral values into account in building our own systems.",

India has unmatched talent and ambition with an inherent tendency to work hard; then what is it that keeps India from overtaking the world? Why does India as a nation settle for the ordinary when the extraordinary is well within reach? Dr. Kalam shares his dream of a nation that is unrivaled, he discusses how he has, from his experience, met such skilled people whose visions can transform the nation. It is imperative that one searches for one's own solutions and find role models in countrymen instead of looking toward the other nations. India must not strive to be the next America or Japan but has to be the strong nation it is capable of becoming. For this, all the trapped energies and initiatives need to be freed instead of suppressing them. In the audiobook, we are introduced to numerous role models who are hiding among us. Words of wisdom from saints and seers that the author encountered through his life have been quoted. The audiobook proceeds to address the issues at hand and mentions some reforms that have to be incorporated in politics and policies. The policy-making procedure of the nation requires major reform. The youth has to be given a stage, and the reins of the nation need to be passed on. The audiobook motivates the young minds and forces the positive auras together to build the face of a new nation.",

He met over 21 million children and young people in India and outside and spoke to them about the power of knowledge, ambition, moral behaviour and the need to bring about change in society.

In Learning How to Fly some of his nearly 2,000 lectures have been compiled. These lectures were addressed to teachers and students in school and beyond. In each one of them he has spoken about preparing oneself best for life, to identify and overcome challenges and how to bring out the best within each individual. Through stories from his own life, those of his teachers and mentors as well as stories of some of the greatest men and women of the world, and the latest developments in science and technology, he shows us the importance of dreams and the hard work needed to turn those dreams into reality. Filled with warmth, inspiration and a positive attitude, Learning How to Fly is essential reading for every Indian, young and old.",
