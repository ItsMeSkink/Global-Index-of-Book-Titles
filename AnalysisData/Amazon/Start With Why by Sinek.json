Now Find Your Why picks up where Start With Why left off. It shows you how to apply Simon Sinek\u2019s powerful insights so that you can find more inspiration at work -- and in turn inspire those around you. I believe fulfillment is a right and not a privilege. We are all entitled to wake up in the morning inspired to go to work, feel safe when we\u2019re there and return home fulfilled at the end of the day. Achieving that fulfillment starts with understanding exactly WHY we do what we do. As Start With Why has spread around the world, countless readers have asked me the same question: How can I apply Start With Why to my career, team, company or nonprofit? Along with two of my colleagues, Peter Docker and David Mead, I created this hands-on, step-by-step guide to help you find your WHY. With detailed exercises, illustrations, and action steps for every stage of the process, Find Your Why can help you address many important concerns, including: * What if my WHY sounds just like my competitor\u2019s? * Can I have more than one WHY? * If my work doesn\u2019t match my WHY, what should I do? * What if my team can\u2019t agree on our WHY? Whether you've just started your first job, are leading a team, or are CEO of your own company, the exercises in this book will help guide you on a path to long-term success and fulfillment, for both you and your colleagues.

Most companies rely on manipulations to attract customers and employees; they use short-term motivators that do not inspire or encourage loyalty. Customers who are not inspired will stop buying the product as soon as the company cannot keep up the manipulative strategies, and employees are less motivated and less productive when they are not inspired. Instead of strategies based on keeping up with competitors and metrics meant to determine the company's basic productivity, companies should form strategies that advance its purpose, or its \"why\" and find metrics that measure \"how\" the company advances that \"why\".

Starting with WHY not only helps you know which is the right advice for you to follow, but also to know which decisions will put you out of balance. There are 4 chapters: WHY discovery for individuals where you bring together your memories from the past \u2013 specific experiences and people in your life that have shaped who you are today. From these stories you identify your themes, choose the one that stands out the most, and use it as a base for your Why Statement. HOW discovery for individuals where you narrow the remaining list of themes until you have no more than five, turn them into verbs or actionable statements and write a short description that gives each one some context. WHAT discovery for individuals where you think what WHATs are possible \u2013 what kind of lifestyle, career choices, and people you surround yourself with \u2013 would be aligned with your WHY. The Celery test for individuals where you use your WHY as a filter for decision-making. Every action you take, every decision you make should pass the celery test.

Starting with WHY not only helps you know which is the right advice for you to follow, but also to know which decisions will put you out of balance. There are 4 chapters: WHY discovery for individuals where you bring together your memories from the past \u2013 specific experiences and people in your life that have shaped who you are today. From these stories you identify your themes, choose the one that stands out the most, and use it as a base for your Why Statement. HOW discovery for individuals where you narrow the remaining list of themes until you have no more than five, turn them into verbs or actionable statements and write a short description that gives each one some context. WHAT discovery for individuals where you think what WHATs are possible \u2013 what kind of lifestyle, career choices, and people you surround yourself with \u2013 would be aligned with your WHY.

This is a \"must listen\" book for anyone who wants to lead their organization to success. What is the great secret that puts one person or organization way out in front of the rest? How do they get to be so much more innovative and successful and remain so, whatever their competitors do? Well, the answer is that asking questions is a good start but they have to be the right questions. Sinek tells us that the most vital question is \"why.\" In business, it is obviously a good idea to know what you do. You need to know how you do it. But most important of all is to know why you do what you do. In Start with Why, the author explains that it's the basic question all the great leaders in business, social reform, or any other field asked themselves right at the beginning. He examines such leaders as Steve Jobs, Richard Branson or Martin Luther King and notes that they all applied the same thinking and started from the same question: why? The book goes on to show us how to apply this principle in our own businesses. It explains how to get from \"what?\" to \"how?\" and on to \"why?\" Why are we doing what we do rather than something else?

Now this beautifully illustrated book will inspire more readers to ask for help, help others, and discover their own courage through a charming story about change. Life is a series of choices. Do we go left or right? Jump forward or hold back? Sometimes our choices work out for the better\u2026and sometimes they don\u2019t. But there is one choice, regardless of every other decision, that profoundly affects how we feel about our journey: Do we go alone or do we go together? It is the courageous few who ask for help. It is the giving few willing to help others. We can all find the courage we need and know the joy of service \u2013 the minute we learn that together is better. Filled with inspiring quotes, this richly illustrated fable tells a delightful story of three kids who go on a journey to a new playground and take a stand for what they believe. The story is a metaphor for anyone looking to make a change or wondering how to pursue their dreams. And the message is simple: relationships \u2013 real, human relationships \u2013 really, really matter. The stronger our relationships, the stronger the bonds of trust and cooperation, the more we can accomplish and the more joy and fulfillment we get from our work and personal lives. The three heroes are archetypes who represent us all at various points in our lives. Their main challenge is the same one we face every day: How can we find the things we\u2019re looking for? According to Sinek, if we each do our part to help advance a shared vision, we can build the world we imagine. In addition to the story itself, Sinek shares such profound lessons as: \u00b7 A team is not a group of people that work together. A team is a group of people that trust each other. \u00b7 Fight against something and we focus on the thing we hate. Fight for something and we focus on the thing we love. \u00b7 Working hard for something we don\u2019t care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion. \u00b7 A star wants to see himself rise to the top. A leader wants to see those around him become stars. Together is Better was designed to be given as a gift to someone you want to inspire, or to say thank you to someone who inspires you. It's completely different from Sinek's previous work.

Simon Sinek started a movement in 2009 helping people become inspired at work and inspire people around them. Since then, he has inspired millions of people with his idea\u2014including more than 28 million people who have watched his TED Talk which is the third most watched TED talks of all time. Sinek asks an essential question: Why do some people and organizations become more innovative, influential, and profitable than others? Why do some companies have greater loyalty from their customers and employees? Even among successful ones, why are so few able to repeat their success? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had one thing in common\u2014they started with WHY. They discovered that people can\u2019t buy a product, service, movement, or even idea unless they understand the WHY behind it. Start with Why shares how leaders\u2014those who have the greatest influence in the world\u2014think, act, and communicate in the same way. And it\u2019s the opposite of what everybody else does. Sinek calls this concept the Golden Circle and it explains how organizations are built, movements are led, and people are inspired. And it starts with WHY.

Find out how following your passion and weaving it into every part of your business or cause can help you attain levels of success few are ever able to reach. Start with Why by Simon Sinek explores what it means to be a true leader. Many people have lofty goals to change an industry, but few are able to accomplish them. Most are motivated by the wrong things, like money and power, or they go about running a business in a manner that is essentially back-to-front.

Now Find Your Why picks up where Start With Why left off. It shows you how to apply Simon Sinek\u2019s powerful insights so that you can find more inspiration at work - and in turn inspire those around you. I believe fulfillment is a right and not a privilege. We are all entitled to wake up in the morning inspired to go to work, feel safe when we\u2019re there, and return home fulfilled at the end of the day. Achieving that fulfillment starts with understanding exactly WHY we do what we do. As Start With Why has spread around the world, countless readers have asked me the same question: How can I apply Start With Why to my career, team, company or nonprofit? Along with two of my colleagues, Peter Docker and David Mead, I created this hands-on, step-by-step guide to help you find your WHY. With detailed exercises and action steps for every stage of the process, Find Your Why can help you address many important concerns, including: What if my WHY sounds just like my competitors? Can I have more than one WHY? If my work doesn\u2019t match my WHY, what should I do? What if my team can\u2019t agree on our WHY? Whether you've just started your first job, are leading a team, or are CEO of your own company, the exercises in this book will help guide you on a path to long-term success and fulfillment, for both you and your colleagues.

How do we win a game that has no end? Finite games, like football or chess, have known players, fixed rules and a clear endpoint. The winners and losers are easily identified. Infinite games, games with no finish line, like business or politics, or life itself, have players who come and go. The rules of an infinite game are changeable while infinite games have no defined endpoint. There are no winners or losers\u2014only ahead and behind. The question is, how do we play to succeed in the game we\u2019re in? In this revelatory new book, Simon Sinek offers a framework for leading with an infinite mindset. On one hand, none of us can resist the fleeting thrills of a promotion earned or a tournament won, yet these rewards fade quickly. In pursuit of a Just Cause, we will commit to a vision of a future world so appealing that we will build it week after week, month after month, year after year. Although we do not know the exact form this world will take, working toward it gives our work and our life meaning.

With Start with Why , Simon Sinek inspired a movement to build a world in which the vast majority of us can feel safe while we are at work and fulfilled when we go home at night. Now, along with two of his colleagues, Peter Docker and David Mead, Sinek has created a guide to the most important step any business can take: finding your why. This easy-to-follow guide starts with the search for your personal why, and then expands to helping your colleagues find your organization's why. With detailed instructions on every stage in the process, the book also answer common concerns, such as: What if my why sounds like my competitor's? Can you have more than one why? And, if my work doesn't match my why, what do I do?

You order it immediately and can't wait to get your hands on it. When it finally arrives, you open it up quickly, intent on devouring the information and making the changes you want in your life. You read the cover blurb and maybe a page or two, when suddenly your kids start screaming and need your attention, or you have to cook dinner, or it's time for the news, or... anyway, you get the picture. Life happens and gets in the way. Eventually the book becomes one more thing you didn't follow through, another lost opportunity; and you become less confident in your ability to affect any real changes in your life. You become a spectator, watching life pass you by. If this sounds familiar, don't get discouraged. Realise that today doesn't have to be like yesterday and the past doesn't determine who you are.

Now with an expanded chapter and appendix on leading millennials, based on Simon Sinek's viral video \"The Millennial Question\" (150+ million views). Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled. This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful organizations, great leaders create environments in which people naturally work together to do remarkable things. In his work with organizations around the world, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives are offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why? The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general. \"Officers eat last,\" he said. Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders sacrifice their own comfort--even their own survival--for the good of those in their care. Too many workplaces are driven by cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest. But the best ones foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a \"Circle of Safety\" that separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside. Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories that range from the military to big business, from government to investment banking.", "pages": null, "publisher": "Brilliance Audio; Unabridged edition (May 23, 2017)", "isbn": 9781543614626, "thumbnail": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/619Mk9RQ17L.jpg", "rating": 4.7, "categories": ["Business & Money", "Books", "Business Culture", "Popular Social Psychology & Interactions", "Workplace Culture (Books)", "Leadership & Motivation"], "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/1543614620"}, {"title": "Start with Why (Korean Edition)", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Korean Edition"], "description": "", "pages": null, "publisher": null, "isbn": 9788928615810, "thumbnail": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zuO-fqULL._SL1500_.jpg", "rating": 0, "categories": ["More Languages", "Books", "Foreign Language Books"], "url": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/892861581X"}, {"title": "Start with Why 3 Books Set Collection (Leaders Eat Last, Start with Why, Find Your Why) Paperback 2017", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Simon Sinek"], "description": "Finally in paperback: the New York Times bestseller by the acclaimed, bestselling author of Start With Why and Together is Better.

How do we win a game that has no end? Finite games, like football or chess, have known players, fixed rules and a clear endpoint. The winners and losers are easily identified. Infinite games, games with no finish line, like business or politics, or life itself, have players who come and go. The rules of an infinite game are changeable while infinite games have no defined endpoint. There are no winners or losers\u2014only ahead and behind. The question is, how do we play to succeed in the game we\u2019re in? In this revelatory book, Simon Sinek offers a framework for leading with an infinite mindset. On one hand, none of us can resist the fleeting thrills of a promotion earned or a tournament won, yet these rewards fade quickly. In pursuit of a Just Cause, we will commit to a vision of a future world so appealing that we will build it week after week, month after month, year after year. Although we do not know the exact form this world will take, working toward it gives our work and our life meaning.
