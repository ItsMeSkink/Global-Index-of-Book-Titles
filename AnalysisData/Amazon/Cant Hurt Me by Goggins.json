But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America. In this curse-word-free edition of Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

    "description": "Disclaimer: The Summary of the original book Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds By David Goggins.Everyone wants to be fit and healthy, but somehow most people do not find the time to go to the gym or follow up with their exercise sessions. Some famous excuses include spending time with family and friends, working long hours, or even having a 9-5 job can stop people from following up on their dreams.Most people postpone their dreams for another day. They forget about their commitments to stay fit and healthy or to achieve something in the present. What is the difference between David Goggins and these people? Hard work and determination.David Goggins narrated his experiences from early childhood when his abusive father did not beat him, his mother, and his brother when they did not obey, but he also forced them to work hard until midnight. His childhood was marked by many abusive experiences; he used to fall asleep during courses and finally developed toxic stress.Among other symptoms, David could not learn as easily as others, due to his condition. By his late teenage years, he was barely able to read. Without a bright opportunity for his future and challenged by poverty, past traumas, and continuous stress, David decided that he wished to join the army.However, the path was not smooth, as he walked out on his dream because the fear of swimming conquered him. Finding his refuge in food, he gains weight and has a dead-end job as a pest exterminator. Soon, he finds a new motivation as he sees a documentary about Navy SEALs. This is the crucial point in which he turns around his life, starts a strict fitness routine, and makes his dreams come true.",

Most of today's popular truisms fall into this category. We will consider one of them, \"what you don't know can't hurt you,\" widely accepted as truth by many, if not most individuals, living in our western hemisphere. By holding this half truth up to the light, we will discover that whereas it is certainly true; it is also only a half truth which provides little value in the way of guidance it purports to give. And when you consider its inferences and implications and accept those as truth, it actually becomes a lie: and the truth of this declaration will become increasingly clear as we move through our examination.

    "description": "This audiobook is a comprehensive summary of Can't Hurt Me . David Goggins had a mission: The only way he could make it into the Navy SEALs training camp was to lose more than 100 pounds in less than three months. After years of neglecting his body, he went for a jog and keeled over in pain a half-mile later. Fast-forward a year, and he\u2019s engaging the enemy as a full-fledged US Navy SEAL. How the heck did that happen? Today, David Goggins is an ultramarathoner, retired US Navy SEAL, former Guinness World Record holder, and all-around unstoppable warrior. Can\u2019t Hurt Me has brought countless people through Goggins\u2019 hell and back - from an abusive childhood and impoverished adolescence to the pinnacles of human achievement. Goggins takes the listener under his wing not only to recount a fascinating journey but to explain the methods that he used to overcome everything that life threw against him. So many of us live our lives within the limits that we staked out long ago. We run less than our farthest distance. We study and learn less than we did when we were in school. We work less than we did on our first day. Can\u2019t Hurt Me explains the benefits of flipping this script and living in a constant state of engaging with the impossible. That process of breaking through the walls of life is what this book is about. And every second of it is a brutal, bloody, beautiful ride that you don\u2019t want to miss. Simply, this book is for anyone who dares to engage with the impossible. Disclaimer: This is a summary of David Goggins' Can't Hurt Me . Our intention is sincere in that listeners could use this summary as an introduction or a companion to the original book, not as a substitute. The average summary narration on is 15 minutes long. We can back our claim because we deliver over three times the value of ordinary summaries through approximately 45 minutes of immersive, detail-rich summary and analysis of the original book.",

    "description": "Hello Friend, Do you want to follow David Goggin's journey from utterly dejected to world champion? Would you want to apply the same steps he used to overcome immense obstacles to your life? How about doing that practically ? Great, right? \u2713 The book Can\u2019t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds by David Goggins is an extraordinary work of non-fiction loaded with life lessons and wisdom for readers from all walks of life. \u2713 This workbook\u2019s singular goal is to give you practical steps and help you develop grit, wisdom, and enduring strength to master your mind and defy the odds stacked high against you. It has condensed David Goggin\u2019s core messages and life advice into proven exercises and bit-sized summaries that deliver the essence and life-changing tendencies of the book\u2019s ideas. \u2713 Each chapter begins with a summary of the chapter it analyzes and follows with a well thought out exercise for you to carry out based on the book\u2019s recommendations. Please, don\u2019t rush to carry out the exercises, but pause and reflect to think clearly before you attempt them (The exercises require critical thinking). \u2713 Furthermore, it is advised that you don\u2019t use this workbook on a one-time basis, rather keep it as your companion and always refer back to it to see your commitments and gauge how far you have come and the distance you still have left to cover. Moreover, the exercises\u2019 nature demands that you refer back to the workbook regularly (Like the potent one on page 43 that needs to be updated daily). \u2713 One great thing about the workbook is that the summaries at the beginning of each chapter will help you get a firm grasp of David\u2019s book even if you haven\u2019t read it. \u2713 There is a notes section at the end of each chapter where you can write your thoughts about each chapter, make plans, and highlight salient points that register with you on a deeper level. \u2713 Above all, you must be dedicated, thoughtful, and enthusiastic for anything in life to work for you. The same goes for using this workbook. Dearest friend, We have truly taken time to be very intentional with our workbook. Unlike other workbooks, we cater the questions, prompts, and activity pages to you, the reader, and how you are progressing and relating to the information so that they can impact you on a personal level. We do sincerely hope you get everything you\u2019ll need with our workbook. It\u2019s simple but very efficient and powerful. We encourage you not to give up on your journey towards a better life and hope that we at SMARTR READS can at the very least be a part of that journey with you through this workbook. Best wishes, The SMARTR READS Team. Note: This is an Unofficial workbook. It is not endorsed by either the author of Can\u2019t Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds or its publisher.",

Throughout his childhood, he encountered a variety of problems. However, the fact that David could change the situation and accomplish something that most people would deem harsh and unreachable is a testament to his determination. David, the author of the original book, takes us step by step through the process of discovering and reaching our potential. The intricacies of David's life will be disclosed in this summary, which will take you from childhood to maturity and include his childhood memories. Aside from his personal experience, David gives ideas and challenges to help you improve your life and become the best version of yourself.

He became an icon in the armed forces. He inspired countless numbers of students. He set new bars of excellence in every domain he set foot in. Through it all, not everything went his way. He faced numerous failures, injustices, and just plain bad breaks over the years. There were times when he quit and became lost. There were times when he drove himself or others too hard... and paid for it later. He doesn\u2019t pretend to have gotten everything right along the way, but he does share his entire story along with the lessons he learned at each stage.

    "description": "David Goggins experienced a terrible childhood characterized by extreme adversity (including hunger, racism, and abuse). Through self-discipline, mental fortitude, and arduous effort, Goggins transformed himself from a hopeless, overweight young man with no future to an icon of the US military and one of the best endurance athletes in the world. Because he was the first and only man to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, Outside magazine named him The Fittest (Real) Guy in America. In his eye-opening autobiography Can't Hurt Me, he explains that most people only use 40% of their potential. This is what Goggins refers to as \"The 40% Rule,\" and his life's work has focused on demonstrating how anyone can apply this idea to overcome challenges, face their fears, and reach their full potential. Can't Hurt Me expanded and annotated, with more than two hours of new content, including David's innermost thoughts and never-before-told anecdotes. has no alternative formats available.
