    "description": "For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare -- poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him \"The Fittest (Real) Man in America.\" In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

    "description": "F\u00fcr David Goggins war die Kindheit ein Albtraum \u2013 Armut, Vorurteile und k\u00f6rperliche Misshandlung verfolgten ihn bis in seine Tr\u00e4ume. Doch durch Selbstdisziplin, mentale St\u00e4rke und harte Arbeit verwandelte er sich vom depressiven, \u00fcbergewichtigen Jugendlichen ohne Perspektive in eine Ikone der U.S. Army und einen der Top-Ausdauersportler der Welt. Er ist der Einzige, der je das Elitetraining sowohl zum Navy SEAL als auch U.S. Army Ranger und Air Force Tactical Air Controller bestand, au\u00dferdem stellte er zahlreiche Ausdauerrekorde auf. In \u00bbCan't Hurt Me\u00ab erz\u00e4hlt er seine wahrlich erstaunliche Lebensgeschichte und zeigt, dass die meisten von uns nicht einmal die H\u00e4lfte ihres Potenzials aussch\u00f6pfen. Goggins bezeichnet dies als 40-Prozent-Regel. Sein herausragendes Beispiel veranschaulicht hingegen, wie es jedem gelingen kann, das zu \u00e4ndern und Schmerzgrenzen und \u00c4ngste zu \u00fcberwinden.",
