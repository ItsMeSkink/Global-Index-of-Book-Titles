Price, president, Franklin Mutual Advisors, Inc. Benjamin Graham has been called the most important investment thinker of the twentieth century. As a master investor, pioneering stock analyst, and mentor to investment superstars, he has no peer. The volume you hold in your hands is Graham's timeless guide to interpreting and understanding financial statements. It has long been out of print, but now joins Graham's other masterpieces, The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, as the three priceless keys to understanding Graham and value investing. The advice he offers in this book is as useful and prescient today as it was sixty years ago. As he writes in the preface, \"if you have precise information as to a company's present financial position and its past earnings record, you are better equipped to gauge its future possibilities. And this is the essential function and value of security analysis.\" Written just three years after his landmark Security Analysis, The Interpretation of Financial Statements gets to the heart of the master's ideas on value investing in astonishingly few pages. Readers will learn to analyze a company's balance sheets and income statements and arrive at a true understanding of its financial position and earnings record. Graham provides simple tests any reader can apply to determine the financial health and well-being of any company. This volume is an exact text replica of the first edition of The Interpretation of Financial Statements, published by Harper & Brothers in 1937. Graham's original language has been restored, and readers can be assured that every idea and technique presented here appears exactly as Graham intended. Highly practical and accessible, it is an essential guide for all business people--and makes the perfect companion volume to Graham's investment masterpiece The Intelligent Investor.", "pages": 154, "isbn": 9780887309137, "publisher": "Harper Collins", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "rating": 4.5, "thumbnails": ["http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m9YejLCw5hQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780887309137-us.jpg"]}, {"title": "Benjamin Graham on Investing: Enduring Lessons from the Father of Value Investing", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Benjamin Graham", "Rodney G.

There\u2019s been no reason to look for another.\u201d \u2014Warren Buffett, on the writings of Benjamin Graham Legendary investing author and philosopher Benjamin Graham lived through interesting times. Soon after his graduation from Columbia College, the nation entered the First World War. As the stock market fluctuated in wild dips and peaks, the government seized control of the railroad industry, inflation and interest rates rose dramatically, and economic depression loomed on the horizon. During these events\u2014and perhaps inspired by them\u2014Graham began writing articles for The Magazine of Wall Street, putting to paper his earliest ideas on value investing and security analysis. For the first time, these important works have been anthologized into a single volume. Benjamin Graham on Investing is a treasure trove of rare and out-of-print articles that document the early flashes of genius from a man whose ideas and theories would revolutionize investment philosophy and inspire the careers of such luminaries as Warren Buffett, Seth Klarman, Charlie Munger, and countless other top-tier investors. The early works of Benjamin Graham have never been as relevant as they are today. The world\u2019s markets are undergoing changeon a scale not unlike that of Graham\u2019s era. David Darst, one of the world\u2019s most respected experts on asset allocation, provides insightful analyses connecting Graham\u2019s articles to events today. ,i>Benjamin Graham on Investing is a timeless classic that continues to have relevance more than 30 years after the author\u2019s death.", "pages": 0, "isbn": 9780071621427, "publisher": "Mcgraw-hill", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "rating": null, "thumbnails": ["http://books.google.com/books/content?id=edjEzwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780071621427-us.jpg"]}, {"title": "The Intelligent Investor", "subtitle": "The Definitive Book on Value Investing", "authors": ["Benjamin Graham"], "description": "The best book on investing ever written, this classic work offers sound and safe principles for investing principles that have worked for more than the half century since the first edition was published.

Miller, CFA, Legg Mason Funds Management About the Book: When Benjamin Graham began working on Wall Street in 1914, the center of American finance resembled a lawless frontier. The concept of regulatory laws was in its infancy, the SEC wouldn\u2019t see the light of day for 20 years, and many firms hid assets and earnings from nosy outsiders. And security analysts didn\u2019t exist as we know them. They were called \u201cdiagnosticians,\u201d and they didn\u2019t do much analyzing. These investors prided themselves on going with the \u201cfeel\u201d of the market, and most of them rarely looked at a financial statement. Appalled by the lack of research and quantification, Benjamin Graham set out to change all this\u2014and ended up creating the discipline of modern security analysis. A collection of rare writings by and interviews with one of financial history\u2019s most brilliant visionaries, Benjamin Graham, Building a Profession presents Graham\u2019s evolution of ideas on security analysis spanning five decades. Articles include: \u201cShould Security Analysts Have a Professional Rating? The Affirmative Case\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1945) \u201cToward a Science of Security Analysis\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1952) \u201cInflated Treasuries and Deflated Stockholders: Are Corporations Milking Their Owners?\u201d Forbes (1932) \u201cThe Future of Financial Analysis\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1963) \u201cControlling versus Outside Stockholders\u201d Virginia Law Weekly (1953) These pages reveal the revolutionary ideas of a man who didn\u2019t so much find his calling as he created it from scratch\u2014and opened the door for entire generations of investors.", "pages": 352, "isbn": 9780071633260, "publisher": "Mcgraw-hill", "categories": ["Business & Economics"], "rating": null, "thumbnails": ["http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mF68mAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api", "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780071633260-us.jpg"]}]
