Ketika buku ini tiba di tanganmu, sangat mungkin bahwa Musk dan SpaceX telah berhasil mendaratkan sebuah roket dari luar angkasa pada sebuah landasan yang mengapung di lautan, atau kembali pada landasan peluncurannya di Florida. Vance menghabiskan waktu lebih dari 50 jam berbincang dengan Musk dan mewawancarai sekitar tiga ratus orang untuk menceritakan jatuh bangun dan riuh rendah yang terjadi dalam kehidupan Musk untuk membangun semua perusahaannya, menggambarkan sosok seorang Musk, seorang pria kompleks yang telah memperbaharui industri Amerika dan memancarkan level baru dari sebuah inovasi-yang tentu saja membuat dirinya memiliki banyak musuh di sepanjang perjalanan karirnya. Di saat banyaknya perusahaan Amerika yang lebih tertarik mengejar keuntungan bisnisnya dengan cara yang mudah, daripada harus mengambil resiko besar dengan mengusahakan sebuah teknologi radikal, Musk berdiri dengan tegap dan menjadi satu-satunya pebisnis yang mengambil alih-bahkan merevolusi-tiga bidang industri sekaligus.
