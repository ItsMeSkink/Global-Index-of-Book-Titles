Benjamin Graham (born Benjamin Grossbaum, May 8, 1894 - September 21, 1976) was an influential economist and professional investor. Graham is considered the first proponent of Value Investing, an investment approach he began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently refined with David Dodd through various editions of their famous book Security Analysis. Well known disciples of Graham include Jean-Marie Eveillard, Warren Buffett, William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn and Walter J. Schloss. Buffett, who credits Graham as grounding him with a sound intellectual investment framework, described him as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. In fact, Graham had such an overwhelming influence on his students that two of them, Buffett and Kahn, named their sons, Howard Graham Buffett and Thomas Graham Kahn, after him.

Jacket design by Ronald Clyne. Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's Intelligent Investor has sold millions of copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" \"Benjamin Graham was a seminal figure on Wall Street and is widely acknowledged to be the father of modern security analysis Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor are still considered the  bibles  for both individual investors and Wall Street professionals\" (The Buffer Stock Project). Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

A popular investment classic, in which Graham, known as the \"father of value investing\", forcefully expounds his investment philosophy; retaining the rare jacket. After the success of his groundbreaking, but specialized work Security Analysis, Graham \"motivated by the need for consumer education and protection. produced a version of his investment text designed for the individual investor. The Intelligent Investor was a hit. A book of less than half the size of Security Analysis, nevertheless it was written with the same clarity and integrity. In it, Graham clearly distinguished between investing and speculating. An investment, he explained, was based on incisive, quantitative analysis, while speculation depends on whim and guesswork. Graham intended the book for the man on Main Street, but as with his earlier book, Wall Street professionals found it indispensable. Because it was so widely read, the book brought greater visibility, respect and prestige to the field of security analysis\" (Lowe, pp. 129-30). \"Those who would criticize Graham's investment philosophy must contend with his spectacular investment record, purported to have returned about 17 percent per annum from 1929 to 1956. Even worse, one must now deal with the unabashed support and investment results of Graham's most famous disciple, Warren E. Buffett, the most famous and successful stock investor of the twentieth century\" (Rubinstein, A History of the Theory of Investments, pp. 68-9). Buffett is quoted as saying \"no one has ever become poor reading Graham\". Dennistoun &amp; Goodman 501; Zerden, p. 23. See Janet Lowe, Benjamin Graham on Value Investing, 1995. Octavo.

Jacket design by Ronald Clyne. Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's Intelligent Investor has sold millions of copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" \"Benjamin Graham was a seminal figure on Wall Street and is widely acknowledged to be the father of modern security analysis Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor are still considered the  bibles  for both individual investors and Wall Street professionals\" (The Buffer Stock Project). Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

    "description": "First edition, early printing (code of F-Y, i.e. June 1949, to copyright page, earliest April 1949). A popular investment classic, in which Graham, known as the \"father of value investing\", forcefully expounds his investment philosophy; retaining the rare jacket. After the success of his groundbreaking, but specialized work Security Analysis, Graham \"motivated by the need for consumer education and protection. produced a version of his investment text designed for the individual investor. The Intelligent Investor was a hit. A book of less than half the size of Security Analysis, nevertheless it was written with the same clarity and integrity. In it, Graham clearly distinguished between investing and speculating. An investment, he explained, was based on incisive, quantitative analysis, while speculation depends on whim and guesswork. Graham intended the book for the man on Main Street, but as with his earlier book, Wall Street professionals found it indispensable. Because it was so widely read, the book brought greater visibility, respect and prestige to the field of security analysis\" (Lowe, pp. 129-30). \"Those who would criticize Graham's investment philosophy must contend with his spectacular investment record, purported to have returned about 17 percent per annum from 1929 to 1956. Even worse, one must now deal with the unabashed support and investment results of Graham's most famous disciple, Warren E. Buffett, the most famous and successful stock investor of the twentieth century\" (Rubinstein, A History of the Theory of Investments, pp. 68-9). Buffett is quoted as saying \"no one has ever become poor reading Graham\". Dennistoun &amp; Goodman 501; Zerden, p. 23. See Janet Lowe, Benjamin Graham on Value Investing, 1995. Octavo.

This identifies both successful and failed recommendations by professional chartists and provides alternative interpretations of these 'live' charts. \"Guide to Charting \"is packed with purpose-drawn charts and worked examples. Written with the private investor's viewpoint in mind, the book's coverage will also interest the more sophisticated, experienced practitioner.",

Jacket design by Ronald Clyne. Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's Intelligent Investor has sold millions of copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E.

Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

A popular investment classic, in which Graham, known as the \"father of value investing\", forcefully expounds his investment philosophy; retaining the rare jacket. After the success of his groundbreaking, but specialized work Security Analysis, Graham \"motivated by the need for consumer education and protection. produced a version of his investment text designed for the individual investor. The Intelligent Investor was a hit. A book of less than half the size of Security Analysis, nevertheless it was written with the same clarity and integrity. In it, Graham clearly distinguished between investing and speculating. An investment, he explained, was based on incisive, quantitative analysis, while speculation depends on whim and guesswork. Graham intended the book for the man on Main Street, but as with his earlier book, Wall Street professionals found it indispensable. Because it was so widely read, the book brought greater visibility, respect and prestige to the field of security analysis\" (Lowe, pp. 129-30). \"Those who would criticize Graham's investment philosophy must contend with his spectacular investment record, purported to have returned about 17 percent per annum from 1929 to 1956. Even worse, one must now deal with the unabashed support and investment results of Graham's most famous disciple, Warren E. Buffett, the most famous and successful stock investor of the twentieth century\" (Rubinstein, A History of the Theory of Investments, pp. 68-9).

Hardcover / Original publishers quarter morocco with gilt lettering on spine and Emblemata on cover. Top edge gilt. Only some faint signs of dampstain to the outer margins of the illustrations.

Graham Carritt on the occasion of his admission to the Livery of the Company in June 1927. With a bookplate of Grocer's Hall to the front pastedown. The Worshipful Company of Grocers is one of the 110 Livery Companies of the City of London and ranks second in order of precedence. Established in 1345, the Grocers comprise one of London's Great Twelve City Livery Companies. The company was founded in the 14th century by members of the Guild of Pepperers, which dates from 1180. The Company was responsible for maintaining standards for the purity of spices and for the setting of certain weights and measures. Its members included London's pharmacists, who separated forming the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries in 1617. The guild was known as the Company of Grossers from 1373 until 1376 when it was renamed the Company of Grocers of London. In 1428, two years after building its first hall in Old Jewry, the Company was granted a Royal Charter by King Henry VI of England. One of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies, it ranks second in the Companies order of precedence after the Mercers' Company. It is said that the Grocers' Company used to be first in the order, until Queen Elizabeth I, as Honorary Master of the Mercers' Company, found herself in procession, after her coronation behind the Grocers' camel which was emitting unfortunate smells; as a result, the Mercers were promoted. Today, the Grocers' Company exists as a charitable, constitutional and ceremonial institution which plays a significant role in the election of and supporting the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs of the City of London. The Company's motto is \"God Grant Grace\". The Company also provides banqueting and conference facilities at Grocers' Hall situated in Prince's Street, next to the Bank of England. The earliest known Grocers' Hall was in Poultry, London, then known as Conningshop-lane on account of the three conies or rabbits hanging over a poulterer's stall in the lane. It was built in 1428 on land once owned by Lord Fitzwalter and let out \"for dinners, funerals, county feasts and weddings.\" The roof and woodwork of the hall were destroyed in the 1666 Great Fire and afterwards a new roof was erected on the old walls while Sir John Cutler, 1st Baronet paid for a new parlour and dining room. The hall was again renovated in 1681 by the future Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Moore. A new hall was built on the same site between 1798 and 1802 when part of the garden was sold to the Bank of England for the expansion of nearby Prince's Street. However, frequent and extensive repairs were required due to defective foundations in the building, which was replaced by a fourth hall, completed in 1893 on Prince's Street. The hall survived the Blitz with only minor damage to its north wing, but was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1965, apparently caused by a lightbulb left on in the grand staircase beneath an oak lintel which smouldered and eventually caught fire. A fifth and final hall was constructed nearby in 1970, also on Prince's Street, which remains the Grocers' home today.

Jacket design by Ronald Clyne. Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's Intelligent Investor has sold millions of copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" \"Benjamin Graham was a seminal figure on Wall Street and is widely acknowledged to be the father of modern security analysis Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor are still considered the  bibles  for both individual investors and Wall Street professionals\" (The Buffer Stock Project). Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

In 2015, The Wall Street Journal wrote that Security Analysis \"is widely viewed as the text of modern value investing. The long-held idea is that some stocks trade significantly below an identified \u00e2  intrinsic value\u00e2   and can be bought at a discount, with a built-in margin of safety against a complete washout.\" In 2016, Fortune called the book \"still the best investment guide\" and noted its \"extraordinary endurance.\" The article states that \"Graham, the primary author, then an obscure professor and money manager, chose the Great Depression as the time to assert his faith in patient security analysis and long-term investing. Given that the market was in the throes of an epochal collapse, very few folks were interested in investing. But Graham had the courage to see through the moment.\" Fortune also argues that one reason the book remained popular is that \"it proffered an irreplaceable approach to investment.

But this unusual, carefully crafted reproduction of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's immortal Security Analysis gives you that chance--to read and treasure a true classic--the book that gave birth to value investing. Continuously in print through five editions, for more than 60 years, and through nearly a million copies, the primer for many of America's most illustrious investors--and the wellspring of Graham and Dodd's Wall Street Immortality--Security Analysis is indisputably the most influential book on investing ever written. Still the investors' bible, it's as frequently consulted today as it was when it first appeared in 1934. Of course, over the years and over five editions, Security Analysis changed. Its language was modernized. New material was added. Metaphors and examples were brought up to date. In the light of changing times, these alterations were necessary and appropriate. But what of the original book? The very durability of this work arouses our curiosity. And what we discover when we return to the original is very simply a classic, a work whose uncompromising worth has not paled since it first saw the light of day in 1934. The original words of Benjamin Graham and David Dodd--put to paper not long after the disastrous Stock Market Crash of 1929--still have the mesmerizing qualities of rigorous honesty and diligent scrutiny, the same riveting power of disciplined thought and determined logic that gave the work its first distinction and began its illustrious career. The words you will read here are eloquent. Not only a financial genius and a man of high repute for honorable dealings, Graham was a man of letters invited to teach in the literature department at Columbia University (as well as in the economics and philosophy departments). But this reproduction is far more than a historical curiosity, an interesting object, and a delightful read. It presents the original Graham/Dodd method of investing--told in their own words as they first described it in the 1930s. What exactly is this method that has drawn such longterm devotion in the notably fickle reaches of Wall Street? Graham and Dodd were Wall Street's first bargain shoppers. In this book they first explain their methods for locating bonds and stocks \"which are selling well below the levels apparently justified by a careful analysis of the relevant facts.\" In this book, they tell you precisely how to find these undervalued securities and analyze those \"relevant facts.\" Are these methods still practical and usable today? The great fortunes created by value investors Warren Buffett, Mario Gabelli, John Neff, Michael Price, and John Bogle testify that they certainly are. In their preface to this book, Graham and Dodd write that they hope their work \"will stand the test of the ever enigmatic future.\" There is no doubt that it has.

Inside, however, lies the single greatest book on investing ever written, which remains remarkably readable, insightful and timely nearly seven decades after its first edition. Graham, a successful investor in his own right, was also a highly effective and influential teacher (one of his students named Warren Buffett has done quite well), and his methods and language are refreshingly clear and (believe it or not) concise. The length of the book is due to the breadth of its content, not to any wordiness or unnecessary diversions. Graham (and his collaborator Dodd) meticulously and methodically builds a framework for the analysis and decision-making necessary for truly good investment decisions. Step-by-step, they lay out a general approach and philosophy for investment (as quite distinct from mere speculation) followed by the systematic analysis of fixed income, convertible and equity securities (i.e., bonds, converts/preferreds, stocks); a detailed discussion of financial statements; and a description of certain underlying differences between the intrinsic value of a business and its fluctuating stock price. As a result, the reader emerges with a solid philosophy and approach for his or her own investments and the analytical tools to make actual buying and selling decisions. This book is neither a get-rich-quick scheme nor an empty academic exercise. Graham does not set out to justify or theorize about the market.

    "description": "\"Graham's ideas inspired the investment community for nearly a century.\"--Smart Money \"Graham's method of investing is as relevant today as it was when he first espoused it during the Roaring Twenties.\"--Investor's Business Daily Benjamin Graham's revolutionary theories have influenced and inspired investors for nearly 70 years. First published in 1934, his Security Analysis is still considered to be the value investing bible for investors of every ilk. Yet, it is the second edition of that book, published in 1940 and long since out of print, that many experts--including Graham prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Warren Buffet--consider to be the definitive edition. This facsimile reproduction of that seminal work makes available to investors, once again, the original thinking of \"this century's (and perhaps history's) most important thinker on applied portfolio investment.\"",

Selling more than one million copies through five editions, it has provided generations of investors with the timeless value investing philosophy and techniques of Benjamin Graham and David L. Dodd. As relevant today as when they first appeared nearly 75 years ago, the teachings of Benjamin Graham, \u201cthe father of value investing,\u201d have withstood the test of time across a wide diversity of market conditions, countries, and asset classes. This new sixth edition, based on the classic 1940 version, is enhanced with 200 additional pages of commentary from some of today\u2019s leading Wall Street money managers. These masters of value investing explain why the principles and techniques of Graham and Dodd are still highly relevant even in today\u2019s vastly different markets. The contributor list includes: Seth A. Klarman, president of The Baupost Group, L.L.C. and author of Margin of Safety James Grant, founder of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, general partner of Nippon Partners Jeffrey M.

    "description": "With nearly a million copies sold, Security Analysis has been continuously in print for more than sixty years. No investment book in history had either the immediate impact, or the long-term relevance and value, of its first edition in 1934. By 1951, seventeen years past its original publication and more than a decade beyond its revised and acclaimed 1940 second edition, authors Benjamin Graham and David Dodd had seen business and investment markets travel from the depths of Depression to the heights of recovery, and had observed investor behavior during both the calm of peacetime and the chaos of World War II. The prescient thinking and insight displayed by Graham and Dodd in the first two editions of Security Analysis reached new heights in the third edition. In words that could just as easily have been written today as fifty years ago, they detail techniques and strategies for attaining success as individual investors, as well as the responsibilities of corporate decision makers to build shareholder value and transparency for those investors. The focus of the book, however, remains its timeless guidance and advice--that careful analysis of balance sheets is the primary road to investment success, with all other considerations little more than distractions. The authors had seen and survived the Great Depression as well as the political and financial instabilities of World War II and were now better able to outline a program for sensible and profitable investing in the latter half of the century. Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 Edition marks the return of this long-out-of-print work to the investment canon. It will reacquaint you with the foundations of value investing--more relevant than ever in tumultuous twenty-first century markets--and allow you to own the third installment in what has come to be regarded as the most accessible and usable title in the history of investment publishing.",

Benjamin Graham (born Benjamin Grossbaum, May 8, 1894 - September 21, 1976) was an influential economist and professional investor. Graham is considered the first proponent of Value Investing, an investment approach he began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently refined with David Dodd through various editions of their famous book Security Analysis. Well known disciples of Graham include Jean-Marie Eveillard, Warren Buffett, William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn and Walter J. Schloss. Buffett, who credits Graham as grounding him with a sound intellectual investment framework, described him as the second most influential person in his life after his own father. In fact, Graham had such an overwhelming influence on his students that two of them, Buffett and Kahn, named their sons, Howard Graham Buffett and Thomas Graham Kahn, after him.

Jacket design by Ronald Clyne. Since it was first published in 1949, Graham's Intelligent Investor has sold millions of copies and has been praised by such luminaries as Warren E. Buffet as \"the best book on investing ever written.\" \"Benjamin Graham was a seminal figure on Wall Street and is widely acknowledged to be the father of modern security analysis Security Analysis and The Intelligent Investor are still considered the  bibles  for both individual investors and Wall Street professionals\" (The Buffer Stock Project). Graham\u00e2  s main investment approach outlined in The Intelligent Investor is that of value investing, an investment strategy that targets undervalued stocks of companies that have the capabilities as businesses to perform well in the long run. To determine value, investors use fundamental analysis. Mathematically, by multiplying forecasted earnings over a certain number of years times a capitalization factor of a company, value can be determined and then compared to the actual price of a stock. There are five factors that are included in determining the capitalization factor, which are long-term growth prospects, quality of management, financial strength and capital structure, dividend record, and current dividend rate. To understand these factors, value investors look at a company's financials, such as annual reports, cash flow statements and EBITDA, and company executives' forecasts and performance.

    "description": "How One Man Created a Profession\u2015and Entirely Transformed the World of Investing \u201cThe small list of investment books that must grace the library of any serious investor\u2015not to gather dust, but to be opened over and over again\u2015just grew by one. This wonderful compilation of the wit and wisdom of Benjamin Graham is the new addition. Savor it. Learn from it. Treasure it.\u201d John C. Bogle, founder and former Chief Executive, The Vanguard Group \u201cIf youth is measured by creativity and excitement about new ideas and a thirst for learning, then Ben Graham-in his early 80s-was the youngest guy in the room when two-dozen stellar investment managers met for three days to explain the inner workings of investment management.\u201d Charles D. Ellis, CFA, Bestselling Author of Winning the Loser's Game \u201cThese writings, spanning over 30 years, help us understand even better the remarkable achievement of this visionary man and his lasting influence on the finance profession.\u201d Burton Malkiel, Princeton University, Bestselling Author of A Random Walk Down Wall Street \u201cInvesting involves the intelligent triangulation between fundamentals, psychology, and prices. Benjamin Graham, Building a Profession . . . illustrates how this investment legend never stopped thinking about this multi-dimensional challenge.\u201d Seth Klarman, The Baupost Group \u201cSerious professionals in the investment business will delight in pouring over this and checking their own thoughts against those of the master.\u201d Jeffrey J. Diermeier, CFA, Diermeier Family Foundation, and former CFA Institute president and CEO \u201cThis is a must-read for anyone interested in the history and development of our profession and the importance of critical investment thinking.\u201d Gary P. Brinson, CFA, GP Brinson Investments \u201cSome investors ('the happy few') know that Ben Graham's writings on financial analysis give them a leg up. So they will want to read this book, and other investors should.\u201d Jean-Marie Eveillard, First Eagle Funds \u201cThe CFA Institute and Jason Zweig have performed an invaluable service to our profession in collecting these [writings] in one volume.\u201d William H. Miller, CFA, Legg Mason Funds Management  About the Book: When Benjamin Graham began working on Wall Street in 1914, the center of American finance resembled a lawless frontier. The concept of regulatory laws was in its infancy, the SEC wouldn\u2019t see the light of day for 20 years, and many firms hid assets and earnings from nosy outsiders. And security analysts didn\u2019t exist as we know them. They were called \u201cdiagnosticians,\u201d and they didn\u2019t do much analyzing. These investors prided themselves on going with the \u201cfeel\u201d of the market, and most of them rarely looked at a financial statement. Appalled by the lack of research and quantification, Benjamin Graham set out to change all this\u2015and ended up creating the discipline of modern security analysis. A collection of rare writings by and interviews with one of financial history\u2019s most brilliant visionaries, Benjamin Graham, Building a Profession presents Graham\u2019s evolution of ideas on security analysis spanning five decades. Articles include: \u201cShould Security Analysts Have a Professional Rating? The Affirmative Case\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1945) \u201cToward a Science of Security Analysis\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1952) \u201cInflated Treasuries and Deflated Stockholders: Are Corporations Milking Their Owners?\u201d Forbes (1932) \u201cThe Future of Financial Analysis\u201d Financial Analysts Journal (1963) \u201cControlling versus Outside Stockholders\u201d Virginia Law Weekly (1953) These pages reveal the revolutionary ideas of a man who didn\u2019t so much find his calling as he created it from scratch\u2015and opened the door for entire generations of investors.",
