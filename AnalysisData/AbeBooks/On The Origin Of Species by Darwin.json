    "description": "It is now generally recognized that the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species in 1859 not only decisively altered the basic concepts of biological theory but had a profound and lasting influence on social, philosophic, and religious thought. This work is rightly regarded as one of the most important books ever printed.The first edition had a freshness and uncompromising directness that were considerably weakened in subsequent editions. Nearly all reprints were based on the greatly modified sixth edition (1872), and the only modern reprint changes pagination, making references to the original very difficult. Clearly, there has been a need for a facsimile reprint. Professor Mayr's introduction has a threefold purpose: to list passages in the first edition that Darwin altered in later editions; to point out instances in which Darwin was clearly pioneering; and to call attention to neglected passages that show Darwin as a much deeper thinker than has been recognized. No one can fail to be impressed by the originality of Darwin's treatment and by the intellectual challenge his work presents even to the modern reader.",

'The theories propounded by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species have had a profound and revolutionary effect, not only on biology but also on philosophy, history, and theology. His concept of natural selection has created eruptive disputes among scientists and religious leaders of his time and ours. The phenomenal importance of his brilliant work is universally recognized, but the present volume marks the first scholarly attempt to compile a complete variorum edition of The Origin of Species, covering all of the extensive variants in the six texts published between 1859 and 1872. Darwin's changes were extensive. His book grew by a third as he rewrote many passages four or five times, and in this edition Morse Peckham has recorded every one of those changes. A book of such distinctive dimensions, on a subject of such profound importance, will be of intense interest to historians of biology, evolution, science, literature, and cultural development. It will be an invaluable aid to the clarification and full comprehension of this complex and renowned scientific classic' (Web site of the University of Pennsylvania Press, which reprinted the book in paperback in 2006, ISBN 0812219546, new price $32.50). 'Darwin produced six editions [of The Origin of Species] during his lifetime and, as Peckham demonstrated nearly fifty years ago, he tinkered constantly with the text, adding and amending, revising and rethinking and, above all, responding to criticism' (Times Literary Supplement). Also, the 2004 Castle Books edition (ISBN: 0785819118) is NOT a reprint of Peckham's Variorum Edition, as some suggest.  Seller Inventory # 18596\n        Contact seller",

Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, is a work of scientific literature which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.

Wilson on the title page, who has drawn an image of an ant. Fine in a fine dust jacket. Jacket design by B. Middleworth. Never before have the four great works of Charles Darwin Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle (1845), The Origin of Species (1859), The Descent of Man (1871), and The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) been collected under one cover. Undertaking this challenging endeavor 123 years after Darwin's death, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Edward O. Wilson has written an introductory essay for the occasion, while providing new, insightful introductions to each of the four volumes and an afterword that examines the fate of evolutionary theory in an era of religious resistance.

Wilson on the title page, who has drawn an image of an ant. Fine in a fine dust jacket. The original slipcase is in near fine condition. Never before have the four great works of Charles Darwin Voyage of the H.M.S. Beagle (1845), The Origin of Species (1859), The Descent of Man (1871), and The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) been collected under one cover. Undertaking this challenging endeavor 123 years after Darwin's death, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Edward O. Wilson has written an introductory essay for the occasion, while providing new, insightful introductions to each of the four volumes and an afterword that examines the fate of evolutionary theory in an era of religious resistance.

Descent with 76 illustrations in the text; \"Origin\" with folding diagram. Front free endpaper of all three volumes with pencilled signature of L. G. Andrews. Freeman 942, 394. Tiny tear to head of one spine, one corner slightly bumped, extremities lightly rubbed, a little chafing to a couple of boards, one page with faint printing smudges, other trivial internal imperfections, but FINE COPIES, internally clean and fresh, in sound bindings with few signs of use. The first edition of \"Descent of Man\" is especially notable for Darwin's first use of the word now virtually synonymous with his name: \"evolution\" appears on p. 2 of volume I, noting the opposition of some older scholars of natural science to his theory of natural selection. Darwin considered \"descent\" a continuation of the other work here, his ground-breaking \"Origin of Species,\" with special focus on man's descent from ape-like creatures. As DNB notes, \"'Descent' of Man brought the full force of evolutionary proposals directly into the heart of ordinary Victorian life.\" Another area of controversy in \"Descent\" was Darwin's theory on sexual selection, which he used to explain physical characteristics more aesthetic than functional, such as the male peacock's splendid tail, the male hummingbird's iridescence, and the male human's beard--all features that might give the possessor advantage in the attraction of a mate. Widely considered the most important biological book ever written, \"Origin\" went through six revised editions following its first appearance in 1859, with our fifth edition marking Darwin's first use of Herbert Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" to describe natural selection. Our copy has never been read all the way through--a couple of leaves that remained uncut by the binder are still attached, and no one has attempted to open them. Copies of these editions appear on the market from time to time, but not often in the little-used condition seen here.

Appleton and Company, 1860. First American edition, third issue. \"Revised Edition\" on title-page and three quotations to verso of half-title. Octavo (7 11/16 x 4 7/8 inches; 196 x 125 mm). [1]-432 pp. With folding chart. Original pebbled brown cloth with covers decoratively stamped in blind. Spine lettered in gilt. Green-coated endpapers. A very slight bit of fraying to top and bottom of the spine. Spine lightly sunned. Previous owner's pencil signature on front free endpaper. And an old ink gift inscription dated 1895 on front flyleaf. Some intermittent light foxing. Housed in a custom full black morocco clamshell. Overall a very good unrestored copy. One of the most influential scientific works of the nineteenth century, On the Origin of Species was (and still is) one of the most controversial. The book caused an uproar immediately upon its publication, and many early copies were burned in protest of its author's ideas. In it \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (Printing and the Mind of Man). Although published the same year as the second English edition, the text of the first American edition (with the two stereo reprints of the same year) is identical to the first English edition (Freeman 373), with the whale-bear story surviving intact.

FIRST EDITION, FIRST ISSUE OF THE AMERICAN PRINTING. RARE IN ORIGINAL CLOTH AND ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE. The copy is unrestored and unsophisticated, the hinges still in unusually nice condition as is the cloth of the covers. Darwin's Revolutionary Masterwork, in which he not only \"drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken.\" [PMM) Together with Copernicus' DE REVOLUTIONIBUS and Newton's PRINCIPIA, it is deemed one of the three greatest and most important scientific works ever penned. \"The most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" and \"The most important biological work ever written\" (Horblit, Freeman). Darwin's elaboration of the theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for the controversy over the evolution of man, and with only slight modification by such scientists as Stephen Jay Gould, Darwin's ideas remain the umbra under which most current biological research is conducted. Darwin had intended the book to be an abstract of his 'big book' on transmutation, of which only the first part (Variation Under Domestication, 1868) was published in his lifetime. The book comes from the Lee- Perkins - Shattuck - Peabody collection, a family line that is famous throughout New England.  Seller Inventory # 32188\n        Contact seller",

Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, is a work of scientific literature which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.

The text is taken from the second edition (1860), which incorporated some minor corrections but is otherwise the purest distillation of Darwin's original vision.

    "description": "An instant bestseller in 1859, few books have had such a revolutionary impact and left such a lasting impression as On the Origin of Species. Possibly the most important and challenging scientific book ever published, Darwin's language remains surprisingly modern and direct. It is presented here in a faithful yet generously detailed facsimile edition. The text is taken from the second edition (1860), which incorporated some minor corrections but is otherwise the purest distillation of Darwin's original vision. It includes a new foreword as well as an introductory appendix, An Historical Sketch of the Recent Progress of Opinion on the Origin, taken from the third edition (1861).",

Exceedingly Rare &amp; fragile French popular wrappered edition of Charles Darwin's, Origin of Species (1859). This wrappered \"populaire\" and \"quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition\" [fourth edition] of The Origin was based on the third French translation by Mlle. Royer. It was authorized by Darwin and incorporated the author's latest changes in his English imprints. Because French paper has always been problematic: tending to become brittle, chip, and disintegrate, this edition in wrappers is breathtakingly rare. The small paper label of \"M. Riquier, percepteur honoraire / S440 . . . PONT-de-METZ\" is pasted down inoffensively on lower portion of the half-title, below which there is his stamped name, \"M. Riquirer.\" This stereotyped edition incorporates the latest Additions by the Author [Charles Darwin] and Notes by the learned translator, Mammoiselle Royer, a self-described \"disciple de Lamar[c]k.\" Surprisingly, she refers in her Preface to this fourth edition to Darwin's death [in 1882] just as this edition was about to be published, and to twenty-three years having passed since the publication of his first edition in [1859}. This volume is thus a reissue of the Fourth French edition in wrappered format for popular consumption, which was to have appeared in 1882.coincidentally, the year in which her esteemed and communicative Charles Darwin had just died. This edition is not noted by R. B. Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin / An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, Second Edition (1977). Freeman identifies the Fourth French edition of L'Origin as #658: \"[ ] Paris, C. Marpon &amp; E Flammarion. I [not our Roman numeral \"L\" {i.e., 50-pages} expanded Preface] + 650 pp.\" Though Freeman notes #669 a two-volume Flammarion edition with 675 pp. that appeared in 1918 that was also translated by Mlle. Royer, he has no mention of this rarity; nor does the Fifth edition have any date, but closely resembles #658, the Fourth edition. We can, therefore, date this popular \"paperback\" [reissue of the fourth edition] to 1882, though it bears no date on its title page. The learned translator also refers to \"la Th\u00e9orie d'\u00e9volution par S\u00e9lection Naturelle\" as \"Darwinism,\" and to other works she had written: \"sur Lamarck, sa vie, ses travaux et ses doctrines {Revue de Philosophie positive, 1869-70), and her article Darwinism du Dictionnaire des sciences m\u00e9dicales.\" The front wrapper had two small holes in the middle of the title page which was also loose. These minor defects have been carefully restored and strengthened by Scott Kellar, our gifted bookbinder. (The front wrapper retains some discoloration and a rough fringe, while the paper backstrip has losses to its periphery.) Scott has also constructed a protective brown cloth-covered, sturdy clamshell case for this precious volume. Fourth Edition / \"Quatri\u00e8me Edition\" [French] reissued with expanded Preface.

VIII (including half, 520, (6) pp + 1 plate. The very scarce first edition of the highly important first German translation, which appeared just months after the original.This translation came to play a tremendous role in the spreading of Darwinism in Germany and Northern Europe in general. It was through this translation that Darwinian thought reached most of the German scientists and thinkers of the period, and it was this translation that challenged German scholars to think in new ways about morphology, systematics, paleontology, and other biological disciplines. It was from this translation that Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's most famous nineteenth-century proponent and popularizer in Germany, got his Darwinism and was able to further spread the new ideas in his own country. The German translation of Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" appeared in 1860, just months after the original, thanks to Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished German paleontologist whose work in some ways paralleled Darwin's. Bronn's version of the book (with his own notes and commentary appended) did much to determine how Darwin's theory was understood and applied by German biologists, for the translation process involved more than the mere substitution of German words for English.\"Its [Origin of Species] greatest impact on German biological practice lay in the introduction of historical modes of explanation for the observable phenomena of living nature. The historical approach to nature was rejected, not only by the opponents of evolution, but also by the idealist evolutionist. Whether they favored a teleological or a reductionist biology, the idealists could not see the point of a theory that emphasized the irregularities and exceptions in the organic world. In the timeless real of idealist thinking, unchanging laws worked out an inevitable destiny. But Darwin taught his followers to look at living beings one by one. Thus prompted, they recognized, as if for the first time, the surprising fact of anomaly and the wisdom of an open-ended theory.\" (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism). \"Darwin was not happy about the first German translation. It was done from the second English edition by H.G. Bronn, who had, at Darwin's suggestion, added an appendix of the difficulties which occurred to him\" but he had also excised bits of which he did not approve. This edition also contains the historical sketch in its shorter and earlier form.\" (Freeman).Freeman No 672 - Freeman does not mention the lithographed plate.

One of the most influential scientific works of the nineteenth century, On the Origin of Species was (and still is) one of the most controversial. The book caused an uproar immediately upon its publication, and many early copies were burned in protest of its author's ideas. In it \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (Printing and the Mind of Man).

    "description": "S.-Peterburg, 1864. 8vo. Bound in a beautiful recent pastiche-binding of brown half calf with marbled papers over boards and elegant gilding to spine. End-papers renewed. A few dampstains and a bit of brownspotting throughout. A nice copy. XIV, 399, (1) pp. + 1 plate. Rare first edition of the first Russian translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\", a main reason for the widespread effect of Darwinism in Russia, where the theory met less resistance in the 1860'ies than it did in Western Europe. In Russia, Darwinism had a profound influence not only upon the different sciences, but also on philosophy, economic and political thought, and the great literature of the period. For instance, both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky referenced Darwin in their most important works, as did numerous other thinkers of the period.\"In 1864, S.A. Rachinsky, professor of plant physiology at St. Petersburg University, produced the first Russian translation of the \"Origin\". Although not a masterpiece of translation art, the book sold out so quickly that in 1865 it went through a second printing. By this time Darwin's ideas were discussed not only by scientists but also by such popular writers as Dmitri Pisarev and M. A. Antinovich.\" (Glick, p. 232). Rachinsky began translating the \"Origin\" in 1862 and wrote an important article on the theories presented in it, while working on the translation. This article and the translation of the \"Origin\" into Russian were responsible for the great success and rapid, widespread knowledge of Darwinian theory of evolution in Russia. \"Darwin was concerned that the \"Origin of Species\" reach naturalists across the world, but translations of that complicated work raised problems for Darwin. If he found it difficult to make the reader \"understand what is meant\" in England and America, at least in those two countries he and the reader were discussing the \"Origin of Species\" in the same language. Foreign language editions raised not only the thorny question of translating Darwinian terms, but also the problem of translators, who often thought it proper to annotate their editions to explain the \"significance\" of Darwinism. The first Russian translation of the \"Origin of Species\" (1864) appeared, however, without any comment whatever by the translator, Sergei A. Rachinsky, professor of botany at the University of Moscow. Rachinsky had begun the translation in 1862 and published an article on Darwinism while continuing work on the translation in 1863.\" (Rogers, p. 485). In the year of publication of the translation, 1864, Pisarev wrote a long article in \"The Russian Word\", which purports to be a review of this translation\" the critic complains about the absence of notes and commentaries by the translator. Pisarev furthermore points to several errors in the translation and to numerous infelicities of expression. Acknowledging the importance of the work, however, and of the spreading of Darwinism in Russia, he goes on in his own essay to provide a much more popular account of Darwin's theory and to impress upon his readers its revolutionary significance.Nikolai Strakhov also reviewed the translation immediately upon publication, acknowledging the effect it would have. Strakhov, however, recognized potential dangers inherent in the theory and expressed them in his review of Rachinsky's translation. He praised the work for its thoroughness and rejoiced in the evidence that man constituted the highest stage of organic development\" but then he went on to argue that by moving into questions of philosophy and theology, the Darwinists were exceeding the limits of scientific evidence. Like Pisarev, Tolstoy enthusiastically embraced Darwinism. \"The first mention of Darwin in Tolstoy's literary \"Nachlass\" is found in one of the drafts to \"War and Peace\". There Darwin is listed, apparently quite favorably, among leading thinkers \"working toward new truth\" [.] Thus by the late 1860's the name of Darwin as a leading scientist was already familia.

One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs.

A very good copy in contemporary green half-calf over marbled boards, spine gilt with four raised bands, extremities slightly rubbed, some minor foxing, and a small faint dampstain to the upper margin of the first few leaves. xiv, 339, [4ads]pp. St. Petersburg, A.I. Glazunov, Very rare: the first Russian edition of ?the most important biological book ever written? (Freeman). It was translated into Russian by Sergei Aleksandrovich Rachinskii, professor of botany at Moscow University. Unusually for the time, the work appeared without any annotations or explanatory notes by Rachinskii, which was commented on in contemporary reviews of the translation. Instead, he has included Darwin's introduction to the 1860 first American edition. ?Although not a masterwork of translation, the book sold out so quickly that in 1865 it went through a second printing. By this time Darwin's ideas had reached not only scientists and popularizers but also persons eager to integrate evolutionary thought into ideologically oriented writings. M.A. Antonovich in Contemporary greeted Darwin primarily as a master of scientific thought destined to cause drastic changes in the world outlook of the new generation. He viewed the Origin as a major victory for the democratic spirit of the scientific method over the authoritarian sway of metaphysical speculation. He left no doubt about his firm belief in the close interdependence of science and democracy. The strengths of the Origin, as he saw them, were not only in the emphasis on the natural causation of organic evolution but also in the lucidity of its prose and the power of empirical documentation on which it rested. In Darwin's evolutionary idea and the current triumph of the experimental method in physiology he saw the beginning of a new phase in the growth of biology? (Vucinich). A work such as Origin was bound to excite mixed reviews which was also the case in Russia. However, for ?the great majority Darwin became a highly prestigious figure - the embodiment of modern natural science. As A.O. Kovalevskii recalled in 1909: Darwin's theory was received in Russia with profound sympathy. While in Western Europe it met firmly established old traditions which it had first to overcome, in Russia its appearance coincided with the awakening of our society after the Crimean War and here it immediately received the status of full citizenship and ever since has enjoyed widespread popularity? (Todes). The translation appeared at a famously tense time in Russia. The emancipation of the serfs had occurred in 1861, which set off a wave of political reform and revolutionary activity that would culminate in the Revolution of 1917. While it was of obvious importance to the scientific community, there were (inevitably) political ramifications too. James Allen Rogers explains how Darwin's theories were quickly co-opted by, for example, the nihilists. ?This nihilist doctrine that human progress depended only on an understanding and diffusion of the teachings of the natural sciences met a strong challenge in 1864 with the appearance of Charles Darwin's The origin of species in a Russian translation. The leading nihilist, Dmitrii Pisarev, enthusiastically praised Darwin's book in a long review. He strongly emphasized that the core of Darwinian natural selection was a literal interpretation of the idea of the struggle for existence which Darwin had borrowed from Thomas Malthus. Pisarev overlooked Darwin's own insistence that natural selection was far more complex than the idea of the struggle for existence which Darwin had used only in a metaphorical sense. Pisarev interpreted Darwinism to mean that is the struggle for existence in nature or human society only the 'fittest' survive. He saw the contemporary European in his historical struggles with less developed peoples as a manifestation of this superiority.? Rachinskii's translation was reprinted several times until 1895 when Kliment.  Seller Inventory # 230635\n        Contact seller",

Though the work was initially prompted by observations, made during his travels aboard the Beagle from 1831 to 1836, of the biology and geology of isolated islands, Darwin spent nearly 25 years after his return to England accumulating evidence and considering his theory before publishing. \"Although the theory of evolution can be traced to the ancient Greek belief in the 'great chain of being,' Darwin's greatest achievement was to make this centuries-old 'underground' concept acceptable to the scientific community by cogently arguing for the existence of a viable mechanism -- natural selection -- by which new species evolve over vast periods of time. Darwin's influence on biology was fundamental and continues to be felt today\" (Garrison-Morton 220). - Visit our website to see more images!.  Seller Inventory # 003576\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "Rare second edition, second issue, in Freeman's binding variant \"a\" of Darwin's magnum opus. Freeman 376; Norman 594. Octavo, original publisher's green cloth. In excellent condition with the spine gilt bright, contemporary owner's signature to the title, marginalia on pages 72 and 132. A nice example. Darwin \u00e2  revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\u00e2   (PMM 344). \u00e2  Without question a watershed work in the history of modern life sciences, Darwin\u00e2  s Origin elaborated a proposition that species slowly evolve from common ancestors through the mechanism of natural selection. As he himself expected, Darwin\u00e2  s theory became, and continues to be in some circles, the object of intense controversy\u00e2   (American Philosophical Society). \u00e2  The five years [of Darwin\u00e2  s voyage on the Beagle] were the most important event in Darwin\u00e2  s intellectual life and in the history of biological science. Darwin sailed with no formal training. He returned a hard-headed man of science\u00e2 \u00a6 The experiences of his five years in the Beagle, how he dealt with them, and what they led to, built up into a process of epoch-making importance in the history of thought\u00e2   (PMM). Darwin wrote in his diary that all 1250 copies of the first edition, published on November 24, were sold on the first day; however, more accurately, nearly all of the edition had been sold to the trade immediately, with the exception of personal copies set aside for Darwin and review copies.

Its acceptance revolutionized the course of science.As Sir Julian Huxley, the noted biologist, points out in his illuminating introduction, the importance of Darwin\u2019s contribution to modern scientific knowledge is almost impossible to evaluate: \u201ca truly great book, one which can still be read with profit by professional biologist.\u201dIncludes an Introduction by Sir Julian Huxley",

    "description": "Charles Darwin\u2019s classic that exploded into public controversy, revolutionized the course of science, and continues to transform our views of the world.Few other books have created such a lasting storm of controversy as The Origin of Species. Darwin\u2019s theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d stirred up popular debate to fever pitch. Its acceptance revolutionized the course of science.As Sir Julian Huxley, the noted biologist, points out in his illuminating introduction, the importance of Darwin\u2019s contribution to modern scientific knowledge is almost impossible to evaluate: \u201ca truly great book, one which can still be read with profit by professional biologist.\u201dIncludes an Introduction by Sir Julian Huxley",

Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. Yet 'The Origin of the Species' (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world.

As much as anyone in the modern era, Charles Darwin changed the course of human thought. The impact on Western civilization of his seminal work has been broad and deep: not only the biological sciences but also social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature have all been shaped and reshaped by evolutionary concepts. Here, in what Paul Moody (writing in Victorian Studies) has called \"a masterly condensation,\" is a classic edition of Darwin's The Origin of Species . It retains all of the substance of the original book, but only the essential elements of its profuse detail. Philip Appleman, the editor of Darwin, a Norton Critical Edition (\"the best Darwin anthology on the market,\" according to Stephen Jay Gould), has cut deftly to the essence of Darwin's classic, losing none of the continuity or flavor of the original and making available an edition that modern readers will not find overpowering. This revision includes a new introduction by Professor Appleman that perceptively traces Darwin's influence on the world of ideas as well as three additional chapters from Darwin's work.",

Colour-illustrated pasted and free endpapers. Top edges green. No dust jacket., Charles Robert Darwin (1809 ? 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist renown for his contributions to the understanding of evolutionary biology. He has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history. His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. On the Origin of Species, which discusses Darwin?s theory of natural selection, is arguably his most famed work. , Size : 8vo. (170 x 110 mm) A very good example.

    "description": "Sixth edition (\"forty-third thousand\") - and the first edition to use the term \"evolution\" to describe the mechanism of natural selection that Darwin introduced in the book. \"Evolution\" - the word now most associated with THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES - did not appear in the publication until the sixth edition. By then, Darwin was well aware that he had a phenomenon on his hands with the title - it was time to widen his audience. The 6th edition was purposefully set in smaller type, slimming the book's profile and making it more affordable (\"I have been told on authority which I can trust that [.] workmen club together to buy the Origin,\" Darwin noted of previous editions in correspondence in 1871). It also contains a glossary for the first time, making the text more accessible to a non-specialist audience. Appropriately, this copy was once owned by James G. Mead, whale biologist and longtime curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian. Mead is a particular proponent of the anatomical study of marine mammals, a method of examination that Darwin also favored; THE NEW YORK TIMES notes that Mead's use of this technique \"has given scientists a detailed look at species that often can be observed only fleetingly in the wild.\" A notable edition of an iconic work. 7.5'' x 5''. Publisher's green cloth boards with gilt spine lettering. Floral patterned endpapers of the John Murray monogram. xxii, 432 pages, including index; folds from page 185 on are unopened.

    "description": "The notable fifth edition of Charles Darwin's influential 'On the Origin of Species', this edition is important because it is the first time that Darwin uses the term 'survival of the fittest'. Illustrated with a folding plate. The fifth edition, tenth thousandth of this work, an edition of two-thousand copies.This fifth edition is notable, as it was the first time the phrase 'survival of the fittest' was included. The phrase had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his 1864 work 'Principles of Biology'. The term is used first in the heading of Chapter IV.Illustrated with one folding graph, facing plate 132.Sixteen pages of adverts to the rear, dated January 1871.?Half-title is present.Collated, complete.Rebacked with new endpapers.?'On the Origin of Species' is one of the most influential works on science ever published, this work considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology, and thus caused controversy upon its publication. To this day, it remains one of the most important biological works ever published. The work introduces Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when the theory of creation was the standard. It was written for a general audience, and though is naturally involves scientific ideas, it was popular with non-specialist readers.Some of the evidence Darwin gives in this work comes from his research undertaken on his surveys on the H.M.S. Beagle, and the ideas that were hinted at in his work 'The Voyage of the Beagle'.Despite the controversy, or perhaps because of it, 'On the Origin of Species' gained international interest, and started a wide debate on creation versus evolution. Some of those against the work included the bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who wrote a negative review on the work.Among the contemporary reception of this work, there was a debate in Oxford in 1860 including Thomas Huxley, Samuel Wilberforce, Robert FitzRoy, and Benjamin Brodie, all debating the subject of evolution. It is often known as the Huxley-Wilberforce debate. The debate is best remembered for the moment in which Wilberforce, during a heated exchange, asked Huxley whether it was through his grandmother or grandfather that he claimed his descent from a monkey. In a full rebacked cloth binding, with the original boards and spine restored, and new endpapers. Externally, mart. Light bumping to the extremities. Very light rubbing to the boards and spine. Only a couple of small marks to the boards. Spots to the fore edge. Internally, firmly bound. Pages are generally bright with some scattered spots, mostly to the first and last few pages. Ink inscription and stamp to the half-title, and stamps to the title page. Very Good Indeed.  Seller Inventory # 856P28\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "PRESENTATION COPY OF DARWIN'S GREATEST WORK. First edition, presentation copy, of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" (Horblit), \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Freeman), and \"a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general\" (DSB). \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (PMM). Bern Dibner's Heralds of Science describes On the Origin of Species as \"the most important single work in science.\" When the first edition was published on 24 November 1859, in a print run of 1,250 copies, it created an immediate sensation. Fifty-eight were distributed by Murray for review, promotion, and presentation, and Darwin reported that the balance was sold out on the first day of publication. Five further editions, each variously corrected and revised, appeared in Darwin's lifetime, as did eleven translations. The Origin was actually an 'abstract' of a larger work, tentatively titled Natural Selection, that Darwin never completed, although he salvaged much of the first part of the manuscript for The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868. The presentation copies likely number less than 30, allhaving secretarial inscriptions and were sent by the publisherat Darwin's request. \"There are no known author's presentation copies of the first edition inscribed in Darwin's hand\" (Norman). Provenance: Inscribed in a secretarial hand 'Dr. Buist / Bombay / from the author' (as described in the list of presentation copies of the Origin in Vol 8, Appendix III, p 556 and further note on p 559). Dr. George Buist (1805-60) was a founding member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of St. Andres, of which Darwin was an 'Honorable Member'. After taking degrees at St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh, Buist left Scotland for a journalistic posting in India, where his scientific interests led him to serve as Secretary to the Bombay Geographical Society, the same role Darwin played for the London Geographical Society. Both men were fellows of the Royal Society. \"England became quieter and more prosperous in the 1850s, and by mid-decade the professionals were taking over, instituting exams and establishing a meritocracy. The changing social composition of science-typified by the rise of the freethinking biologist Thomas Henry Huxley-promised a better reception for Darwin. Huxley, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and other outsiders were opting for a secular nature in the rationalist Westminster Review and deriding the influence of \"parsondom.\" Darwin had himself lost the last shreds of his belief in Christianity with the tragic death of his oldest daughter, Annie, from typhoid in 1851 . \"After speaking to Huxley and Hooker at Downe in April 1856, Darwin began writing a triple-volume book, tentatively called Natural Selection, which was designed to crush the opposition with a welter of facts. Darwin now had immense scientific and social authority, and his place in the parish was assured when he was sworn in as a justice of the peace in 1857. Encouraged by Lyell, Darwin continued writing through the birth of his 10th and last child, Charles Waring Darwin (born in 1856, when Emma was 48), who was developmentally disabled. Whereas in the 1830s Darwin had thought that species remained perfectly adapted until the environment changed, he now believed that every new variation was imperfect, and that perpetual struggle was the rule. He also explained the evolution of sterile worker bees in 1857. Those could not be selected because they did not breed, so he opted for \"family\" selection (kin selection, as it is known today): the whole colony benefited from.

By then, Darwin was well aware that he had a phenomenon on his hands with the title - it was time to widen his audience. The 6th edition was purposefully set in smaller type, slimming the book's profile and making it more affordable (\"I have been told on authority which I can trust that [.] workmen club together to buy the Origin,\" Darwin noted of previous editions in correspondence in 1871). It also contains a glossary for the first time, making the text more accessible to a non-specialist audience. Appropriately, this copy was once owned by James G. Mead, whale biologist and longtime curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian. Mead is a particular proponent of the anatomical study of marine mammals, a method of examination that Darwin also favored; THE NEW YORK TIMES notes that Mead's use of this technique \"has given scientists a detailed look at species that often can be observed only fleetingly in the wild.\" A notable edition of an iconic work. 7.5'' x 5''.

Folding lithographed plate, 32pp. of publisher's advertisements at rear. Original publisher's green cloth, covers stamped in blind, gilt spine. About near fine, with just a touch of wear to spine ends, rear hinge faintly cracked but secure, binding slightly shaken at signatures in rear but sturdy overall, cloth bright and clean, interior with a bit of spotting but generally very clean and fresh, table at pp. 116-7 with a tear at fold. Overall, a superb copy in original cloth. Freeman 376. Darwin's On the Origin of Species is the basis for all of evolutionary biology. It includes evidence from Darwin's journey aboard the HMS Beagle, including data on the famous finches from the Galapagos Islands. First published in November 1859 with only 1,170 copies for sale, the book sold out in a single day. Just six weeks later, this second edition was printed, which contained many corrections and alterations. One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs. Additionally, in the final sentence of the book, Darwin incorporates a reference to \"the Creator.\".  Seller Inventory # CDAR015\n        Contact seller",

In excellent condition with the spine gilt bright, contemporary owner's signature to the title, marginalia on pages 72 and 132. A nice example. Darwin \u00e2  revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\u00e2   (PMM 344). \u00e2  Without question a watershed work in the history of modern life sciences, Darwin\u00e2  s Origin elaborated a proposition that species slowly evolve from common ancestors through the mechanism of natural selection. As he himself expected, Darwin\u00e2  s theory became, and continues to be in some circles, the object of intense controversy\u00e2   (American Philosophical Society). \u00e2  The five years [of Darwin\u00e2  s voyage on the Beagle] were the most important event in Darwin\u00e2  s intellectual life and in the history of biological science. Darwin sailed with no formal training. He returned a hard-headed man of science\u00e2 \u00a6 The experiences of his five years in the Beagle, how he dealt with them, and what they led to, built up into a process of epoch-making importance in the history of thought\u00e2   (PMM). Darwin wrote in his diary that all 1250 copies of the first edition, published on November 24, were sold on the first day; however, more accurately, nearly all of the edition had been sold to the trade immediately, with the exception of personal copies set aside for Darwin and review copies.

    "description": "PRESENTATION COPY OF DARWIN'S GREATEST WORK. First edition, presentation copy, of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" (Horblit), \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Freeman), and \"a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general\" (DSB). \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (PMM). Bern Dibner's Heralds of Science describes On the Origin of Species as \"the most important single work in science.\" When the first edition was published on 24 November 1859, in a print run of 1,250 copies, it created an immediate sensation. Fifty-eight were distributed by Murray for review, promotion, and presentation, and Darwin reported that the balance was sold out on the first day of publication. Five further editions, each variously corrected and revised, appeared in Darwin's lifetime, as did eleven translations. The Origin was actually an 'abstract' of a larger work, tentatively titled Natural Selection, that Darwin never completed, although he salvaged much of the first part of the manuscript for The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868. The presentation copies likely number less than 30, allhaving secretarial inscriptions and were sent by the publisherat Darwin's request. \"There are no known author's presentation copies of the first edition inscribed in Darwin's hand\" (Norman). Provenance: Inscribed in a secretarial hand 'Dr. Buist / Bombay / from the author' (as described in the list of presentation copies of the Origin in Vol 8, Appendix III, p 556 and further note on p 559). Dr. George Buist (1805-60) was a founding member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of St. Andres, of which Darwin was an 'Honorable Member'. After taking degrees at St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh, Buist left Scotland for a journalistic posting in India, where his scientific interests led him to serve as Secretary to the Bombay Geographical Society, the same role Darwin played for the London Geographical Society. Both men were fellows of the Royal Society. \"England became quieter and more prosperous in the 1850s, and by mid-decade the professionals were taking over, instituting exams and establishing a meritocracy. The changing social composition of science-typified by the rise of the freethinking biologist Thomas Henry Huxley-promised a better reception for Darwin. Huxley, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and other outsiders were opting for a secular nature in the rationalist Westminster Review and deriding the influence of \"parsondom.\" Darwin had himself lost the last shreds of his belief in Christianity with the tragic death of his oldest daughter, Annie, from typhoid in 1851 . \"After speaking to Huxley and Hooker at Downe in April 1856, Darwin began writing a triple-volume book, tentatively called Natural Selection, which was designed to crush the opposition with a welter of facts. Darwin now had immense scientific and social authority, and his place in the parish was assured when he was sworn in as a justice of the peace in 1857. Encouraged by Lyell, Darwin continued writing through the birth of his 10th and last child, Charles Waring Darwin (born in 1856, when Emma was 48), who was developmentally disabled. Whereas in the 1830s Darwin had thought that species remained perfectly adapted until the environment changed, he now believed that every new variation was imperfect, and that perpetual struggle was the rule. He also explained the evolution of sterile worker bees in 1857. Those could not be selected because they did not breed, so he opted for \"family\" selection (kin selection, as it is known today): the whole colony benefited from.

This work is rightly regarded as one of the most important books ever printed.The first edition had a freshness and uncompromising directness that were considerably weakened in subsequent editions. Nearly all reprints were based on the greatly modified sixth edition (1872), and the only modern reprint changes pagination, making references to the original very difficult. Clearly, there has been a need for a facsimile reprint. Professor Mayr's introduction has a threefold purpose: to list passages in the first edition that Darwin altered in later editions; to point out instances in which Darwin was clearly pioneering; and to call attention to neglected passages that show Darwin as a much deeper thinker than has been recognized. No one can fail to be impressed by the originality of Darwin's treatment and by the intellectual challenge his work presents even to the modern reader.",

For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to 'The Origin of Species.' Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation. The Origin of Species shook the foundations of traditional religion to its core.

'The theories propounded by Charles Darwin in The Origin of Species have had a profound and revolutionary effect, not only on biology but also on philosophy, history, and theology. His concept of natural selection has created eruptive disputes among scientists and religious leaders of his time and ours. The phenomenal importance of his brilliant work is universally recognized, but the present volume marks the first scholarly attempt to compile a complete variorum edition of The Origin of Species, covering all of the extensive variants in the six texts published between 1859 and 1872. Darwin's changes were extensive. His book grew by a third as he rewrote many passages four or five times, and in this edition Morse Peckham has recorded every one of those changes. A book of such distinctive dimensions, on a subject of such profound importance, will be of intense interest to historians of biology, evolution, science, literature, and cultural development. It will be an invaluable aid to the clarification and full comprehension of this complex and renowned scientific classic' (Web site of the University of Pennsylvania Press, which reprinted the book in paperback in 2006, ISBN 0812219546, new price $32.50). 'Darwin produced six editions [of The Origin of Species] during his lifetime and, as Peckham demonstrated nearly fifty years ago, he tinkered constantly with the text, adding and amending, revising and rethinking and, above all, responding to criticism' (Times Literary Supplement). Also, the 2004 Castle Books edition (ISBN: 0785819118) is NOT a reprint of Peckham's Variorum Edition, as some suggest.  Seller Inventory # 18596\n        Contact seller",

Jacket shows just a hint of toning to spine and some light wear to extremities. Near fine. Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (published 1859) is a seminal work in naturalist literature and without doubt the pivotal work and foundation of evolutionary science. It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. Darwin's book was the culmination of evidence he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and expanded through continuing investigations and experiments since his return.

The book will endure in future ages so long as a knowledge of science persists among mankind.\" \u2014 NatureIt took Charles Darwin more than twenty years to publish this book, in part because he realized that it would ignite a firestorm of controversy. On the Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world.In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory. This volume is a reprint of the critically acclaimed first edition.",

    "description": "\"The Origin is one of the most important books ever published, and a knowledge of it should be a part of the intellectual equipment of every educated person. . . . The book will endure in future ages so long as a knowledge of science persists among mankind.\" \u2014 NatureIt took Charles Darwin more than twenty years to publish this book, in part because he realized that it would ignite a firestorm of controversy. On the Origin of Species first appeared in 1859, and it remains a continuing source of conflict to this day. Even among those who reject its ideas, however, the work's impact is undeniable. In science, philosophy, and theology, this is a book that changed the world.In addition to its status as the focus of a dramatic turning point in scientific thought, On the Origin of Species stands as a remarkably readable study. Carefully reasoned and well-documented in its arguments, the work offers coherent views of natural selection, adaptation, the struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, and other concepts that form the foundation of modern evolutionary theory. This volume is a reprint of the critically acclaimed first edition.",

    "description": "385 About The Book : In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the con- clusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, &amp;c., as the only possible cause of variation. In one limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. About The Author : Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS (1809  1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey. Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact.

    "description": "Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Original handwritten and signed letter to Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill; written on his Down, Bromley, Kent stationary, dated 27 November [1861]. One sheet, four pages, 8vo (203 x 127 mm), on a bifolium. In the letter Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for providing him with a plethora of orchids. Thanks to her help Darwin was aided in his efforts to write On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects [1862] in which he further gave evidence for the theory provided in the landmark  On the Origin of Species [1859]. A lengthy letter in excellent condition with a beautiful signature and interesting content with direct link to his scientific work. Condition: in near fine condition with usual folding creases to fit an envelope. Content of the letter: A beautifull lengthy letter in which Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for her kindness and assistance in supplying him with plants, and mentioning his forthcoming work on orchids [On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects, published in 1862] which he had promised to send her when it was published.  \u0085I am pleased to hear that my Books have at all interested you; but I fear my little Orchid book will be dry. This summer when at the sea, I meant merely to write a paper for some scientific journal, but the subject grew on me till my M.S. got rather too long for a paper. I am convinced that orchids have a wicked power of witchcraft, for I ought all these months to be working at the dry old bones of poultry, pigeons, and rabbits instead of intensely admiring beautiful orchids.   I mention all this, because, though I can hardly bear to write the words, I must beg your Ladyship not to send any more of your treasures; though perhaps at some future period I may indulge myself with the examination of a few more orchids.   I will not forget your Ladyships most generous offer to give me other flowers, if I require them for observation, &amp; I have no doubt that I shall some time be a beggar again of the beauties   I am truly obliged to your Ladyship for taking the truth to write to Mr. Veitch [Chelsea nursery firm of James Veitch]; who has already sent me some orchids &amp; with much generosity refused all payment for cut flowers.   I see in  Cottage Gardner  of this morning, an account of the beauties of Dangstein, which I shall now read with interest.  Darwin also sends his regards to naturalist Arthur Edward Knox and paleontologist Sir Philip Egerton:  If your Ladyship should meet Mr [Arthur Edward] Knox I hope that you will remember me to him: I spent many years ago a very pleasant morning with him &amp; Sir Philip Egerton at the Zoological Gardens\u0085  In a postscript he adds:  Since writing I have reason to hope that I shall receive a flower of Mormodes from Mr Rucker of Wandsworth . Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill (1826-1913), the daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford, developed a notable garden at Dangstein near Petersfield, where she cultivated orchids and pitcher-plants. Nevill was providing Darwin with samples of, and observations from, her garden. In Insectivorous Plants (1875) Darwin credited Lady Nevill with having sent him an Australian plant and a utricularia montana. In her Reminiscences, Nevill noted that she had maintained correspondence with Darwin, William Hooker, and Joseph Hooker, all of whom she felt had an avid interest in her garden Charles Dawrin needs no introduction. One of the most significant scientists of all time credited for his work on evolution and natural selection. Letters of such length and content rarely come up for sale. First and Fine.

    "description": "385 About The Book : In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the con- clusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, &amp;c., as the only possible cause of variation. In one limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. About The Author : Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS (1809  1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. His proposition that all species of life have descended from common ancestors is now widely accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science. In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. Darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in Westminster Abbey. Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. By the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact.

    "description": "448 About the Book:- This book is considered to be the foundation for evolutionary biology. In this book, Darwin introduced a theory that claimed that populations evolve over generations through a procedure of natural selection. It has been furnished with evidence for the range of life that is created by a common ancestry through a branching pattern of evolution. The author even includes evidence that he gathered on his expedition in 1830s and his succeeding findings from correspondence, research, and experimentation. In short, Darwin s theory stated that each and every specie was fertile enough, and if their offsprings remained, they would be able to increase the populations. Even in periodic fluctuation, the world s population continues to remain the same size. It states that all of the important resources like food are limited, yet will be stable over time. He even states that there is a constant struggle for survival. About the Author:- Charles Robert Darwin was a popular scientist and geologist, best known for his theory of natural selection. His imminent interest in nature and the natural sciences led him to compile the notes on his five - year voyage on HMS Beagle in the form of a journal, which led to further recognition of his expertise in the subject.

    "description": "448 About the Book:- This book is considered to be the foundation for evolutionary biology. In this book, Darwin introduced a theory that claimed that populations evolve over generations through a procedure of natural selection. It has been furnished with evidence for the range of life that is created by a common ancestry through a branching pattern of evolution. The author even includes evidence that he gathered on his expedition in 1830s and his succeeding findings from correspondence, research, and experimentation. In short, Darwin s theory stated that each and every specie was fertile enough, and if their offsprings remained, they would be able to increase the populations. Even in periodic fluctuation, the world s population continues to remain the same size. It states that all of the important resources like food are limited, yet will be stable over time. He even states that there is a constant struggle for survival. About the Author:- Charles Robert Darwin was a popular scientist and geologist, best known for his theory of natural selection. His imminent interest in nature and the natural sciences led him to compile the notes on his five - year voyage on HMS Beagle in the form of a journal, which led to further recognition of his expertise in the subject.

    "description": "448 About the Book:- This book is considered to be the foundation for evolutionary biology. In this book, Darwin introduced a theory that claimed that populations evolve over generations through a procedure of natural selection. It has been furnished with evidence for the range of life that is created by a common ancestry through a branching pattern of evolution. The author even includes evidence that he gathered on his expedition in 1830s and his succeeding findings from correspondence, research, and experimentation. In short, Darwin s theory stated that each and every specie was fertile enough, and if their offsprings remained, they would be able to increase the populations. Even in periodic fluctuation, the world s population continues to remain the same size. It states that all of the important resources like food are limited, yet will be stable over time. He even states that there is a constant struggle for survival. About the Author:- Charles Robert Darwin was a popular scientist and geologist, best known for his theory of natural selection. His imminent interest in nature and the natural sciences led him to compile the notes on his five - year voyage on HMS Beagle in the form of a journal, which led to further recognition of his expertise in the subject.

Darwin\u2019s theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d stirred up popular debate to fever pitch. Its acceptance revolutionized the course of science.As Sir Julian Huxley, the noted biologist, points out in his illuminating introduction, the importance of Darwin\u2019s contribution to modern scientific knowledge is almost impossible to evaluate: \u201ca truly great book, one which can still be read with profit by professional biologist.\u201dIncludes an Introduction by Sir Julian Huxley",

    "description": "Charles Darwin\u2019s classic that exploded into public controversy, revolutionized the course of science, and continues to transform our views of the world.Few other books have created such a lasting storm of controversy as The Origin of Species. Darwin\u2019s theory that species derive from other species by a gradual evolutionary process and that the average level of each species is heightened by the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d stirred up popular debate to fever pitch. Its acceptance revolutionized the course of science.As Sir Julian Huxley, the noted biologist, points out in his illuminating introduction, the importance of Darwin\u2019s contribution to modern scientific knowledge is almost impossible to evaluate: \u201ca truly great book, one which can still be read with profit by professional biologist.\u201dIncludes an Introduction by Sir Julian Huxley",

    "description": "'A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die...'. Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task. Yet 'The Origin of the Species' (1859) is also a humane and inspirational vision of ecological interrelatedness, revealing the complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and - by implication - within the human world. Written for the general reader, in a style which combines the rigour of science with the subtlety of literature, 'The Origin of the Species' remains one of the founding documents of the modern age.",

As much as anyone in the modern era, Charles Darwin changed the course of human thought. The impact on Western civilization of his seminal work has been broad and deep: not only the biological sciences but also social thought, philosophy, ethics, religion, and literature have all been shaped and reshaped by evolutionary concepts. Here, in what Paul Moody (writing in Victorian Studies) has called \"a masterly condensation,\" is a classic edition of Darwin's The Origin of Species . It retains all of the substance of the original book, but only the essential elements of its profuse detail. Philip Appleman, the editor of Darwin, a Norton Critical Edition (\"the best Darwin anthology on the market,\" according to Stephen Jay Gould), has cut deftly to the essence of Darwin's classic, losing none of the continuity or flavor of the original and making available an edition that modern readers will not find overpowering. This revision includes a new introduction by Professor Appleman that perceptively traces Darwin's influence on the world of ideas as well as three additional chapters from Darwin's work.",

Written for a general readership, On the Origin of Species sold out on the day of its publication and has remained in print ever since. Instantly and persistently controversial, the concept of natural selection transformed scientific analysis about all life on Earth.

His ideas have affected public perception of everything from religion to economics. William Bynum's introduction discusses Darwin's life, the publication and reception of the themes of On the Origin of Species, and the subsequent development of its major themes. The new edition also includes brief biographies of some of the most important scientific thinkers leading up to and surrounding the Origin of Species, suggested further reading, notes and a chronology.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Spine gilt (binding variant b, with the vertical of the L of LONDON above the initial vertical of the N of JOHN (MURRAY). Brown-coated end-papers. Top edge of the text-block stained black. Bumps and some wear to the extremities. Splits to the text-block at F, G, N and U. F7 dog-eared. With early graphite marginalia, mostly in the initial parts of the book. Ink ownership signature of \"Wain\" to the front paste-down, with two ink-stamps of the Raven Club Ramsey below. Binder's ticket of Edmonds &amp; Remnants to the rear paste-down. Altogether a solid copy, devoid of sunning. Charles Darwin (1809-1882) put a great many projects on hold to publish his magnum opus, the Origin of Species. Seeking to outline the mechanism of evolution by natural selection (often glossed as \"survival of the fittest,\" which is catchy if incomplete), Darwin explains in remarkably approachable terms the results of his research based on travels and on analysis of specimens back in England. The response was electric, polarizing, vast. The initial print-run of 1,250 evaporated on the day (24 November 1859) of publication (Darwin recounts this in his diary, though see Freeman (the source of the epigraph above) on the difficulties of this) and soon the public clamored for more copies. This resulted in the second edition -- called the \"fifth thousand\" -- in two issues, one without the \"thousand\" notation and one, as the present item, with (there are also some copies with an 1859 date, not distinguished by a separate entry in Freeman) being published not two months later. The texts are identical. The Raven Club in Ramsey (Isle of Man) is a now-defunct Manx social club. Freeman 376.  Seller Inventory # JLR0354\n        Contact seller",

Folding lithographed plate, 32pp. of publisher's advertisements at rear. Original publisher's green cloth, covers stamped in blind, gilt spine. About near fine, with just a touch of wear to spine ends, rear hinge faintly cracked but secure, binding slightly shaken at signatures in rear but sturdy overall, cloth bright and clean, interior with a bit of spotting but generally very clean and fresh, table at pp. 116-7 with a tear at fold. Overall, a superb copy in original cloth. Freeman 376. Darwin's On the Origin of Species is the basis for all of evolutionary biology. It includes evidence from Darwin's journey aboard the HMS Beagle, including data on the famous finches from the Galapagos Islands. First published in November 1859 with only 1,170 copies for sale, the book sold out in a single day. Just six weeks later, this second edition was printed, which contained many corrections and alterations. One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs. Additionally, in the final sentence of the book, Darwin incorporates a reference to \"the Creator.\".  Seller Inventory # CDAR015\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "Illustrated with 1 folding lithographed diagram, facing page 132. xxiii, [1], 596 pages. Thick 8vo, original deep green textured cloth with decorative blind-stamped covers and gilt-stamped spine (some light discolorations on backstrip along with a small blank paper label; neat repairs to spine ends, otherwise just a bit of rubbing overall and the original black glazed endpapers are well preserved; several inked signatures on half title, dated 1870 &amp; 1927, but otherwise rather clean; several pages at rear have minor chipping in margin, one page has a longer closed tear, just touching the text). London: John Murray, 1869. Fifth edition, with additions and corrections, with \"tenth thousand\" designation. A very good(+) copy; clean and tight, with binder's ticket of Edmonds &amp; Remnants on rear paste-down, bound without the rear advertisements. A nice copy of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" and \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Horblit, Freeman 387). Six editions were printed during Darwin's lifetime -- this is the fifth, and the first to use Herbert Spencer's expression \"survival of the fittest\" (chapter iv). \"Tenth Thousand\" -- one of only 2000 copies printed. The foundational evolutionary biology text and one of the most influential science books ever written. Although it has stirred near continuous debate since its publication in 1859, Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection has become the unifying theory of the life sciences.

These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.",

    "description": "PRESENTATION COPY OF DARWIN'S GREATEST WORK. First edition, presentation copy, of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" (Horblit), \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Freeman), and \"a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general\" (DSB). \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (PMM). Bern Dibner's Heralds of Science describes On the Origin of Species as \"the most important single work in science.\" When the first edition was published on 24 November 1859, in a print run of 1,250 copies, it created an immediate sensation. Fifty-eight were distributed by Murray for review, promotion, and presentation, and Darwin reported that the balance was sold out on the first day of publication. Five further editions, each variously corrected and revised, appeared in Darwin's lifetime, as did eleven translations. The Origin was actually an 'abstract' of a larger work, tentatively titled Natural Selection, that Darwin never completed, although he salvaged much of the first part of the manuscript for The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868. The presentation copies likely number less than 30, allhaving secretarial inscriptions and were sent by the publisherat Darwin's request. \"There are no known author's presentation copies of the first edition inscribed in Darwin's hand\" (Norman). Provenance: Inscribed in a secretarial hand 'Dr. Buist / Bombay / from the author' (as described in the list of presentation copies of the Origin in Vol 8, Appendix III, p 556 and further note on p 559). Dr. George Buist (1805-60) was a founding member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of St. Andres, of which Darwin was an 'Honorable Member'. After taking degrees at St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh, Buist left Scotland for a journalistic posting in India, where his scientific interests led him to serve as Secretary to the Bombay Geographical Society, the same role Darwin played for the London Geographical Society. Both men were fellows of the Royal Society. \"England became quieter and more prosperous in the 1850s, and by mid-decade the professionals were taking over, instituting exams and establishing a meritocracy. The changing social composition of science-typified by the rise of the freethinking biologist Thomas Henry Huxley-promised a better reception for Darwin. Huxley, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and other outsiders were opting for a secular nature in the rationalist Westminster Review and deriding the influence of \"parsondom.\" Darwin had himself lost the last shreds of his belief in Christianity with the tragic death of his oldest daughter, Annie, from typhoid in 1851 . \"After speaking to Huxley and Hooker at Downe in April 1856, Darwin began writing a triple-volume book, tentatively called Natural Selection, which was designed to crush the opposition with a welter of facts. Darwin now had immense scientific and social authority, and his place in the parish was assured when he was sworn in as a justice of the peace in 1857. Encouraged by Lyell, Darwin continued writing through the birth of his 10th and last child, Charles Waring Darwin (born in 1856, when Emma was 48), who was developmentally disabled. Whereas in the 1830s Darwin had thought that species remained perfectly adapted until the environment changed, he now believed that every new variation was imperfect, and that perpetual struggle was the rule. He also explained the evolution of sterile worker bees in 1857. Those could not be selected because they did not breed, so he opted for \"family\" selection (kin selection, as it is known today): the whole colony benefited from.

    "description": "Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Original handwritten and signed letter to Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill; written on his Down, Bromley, Kent stationary, dated 27 November [1861]. One sheet, four pages, 8vo (203 x 127 mm), on a bifolium. In the letter Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for providing him with a plethora of orchids. Thanks to her help Darwin was aided in his efforts to write On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects [1862] in which he further gave evidence for the theory provided in the landmark  On the Origin of Species [1859]. A lengthy letter in excellent condition with a beautiful signature and interesting content with direct link to his scientific work. Condition: in near fine condition with usual folding creases to fit an envelope. Content of the letter: A beautifull lengthy letter in which Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for her kindness and assistance in supplying him with plants, and mentioning his forthcoming work on orchids [On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects, published in 1862] which he had promised to send her when it was published.  \u0085I am pleased to hear that my Books have at all interested you; but I fear my little Orchid book will be dry. This summer when at the sea, I meant merely to write a paper for some scientific journal, but the subject grew on me till my M.S. got rather too long for a paper. I am convinced that orchids have a wicked power of witchcraft, for I ought all these months to be working at the dry old bones of poultry, pigeons, and rabbits instead of intensely admiring beautiful orchids.   I mention all this, because, though I can hardly bear to write the words, I must beg your Ladyship not to send any more of your treasures; though perhaps at some future period I may indulge myself with the examination of a few more orchids.   I will not forget your Ladyships most generous offer to give me other flowers, if I require them for observation, &amp; I have no doubt that I shall some time be a beggar again of the beauties   I am truly obliged to your Ladyship for taking the truth to write to Mr. Veitch [Chelsea nursery firm of James Veitch]; who has already sent me some orchids &amp; with much generosity refused all payment for cut flowers.   I see in  Cottage Gardner  of this morning, an account of the beauties of Dangstein, which I shall now read with interest.  Darwin also sends his regards to naturalist Arthur Edward Knox and paleontologist Sir Philip Egerton:  If your Ladyship should meet Mr [Arthur Edward] Knox I hope that you will remember me to him: I spent many years ago a very pleasant morning with him &amp; Sir Philip Egerton at the Zoological Gardens\u0085  In a postscript he adds:  Since writing I have reason to hope that I shall receive a flower of Mormodes from Mr Rucker of Wandsworth . Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill (1826-1913), the daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford, developed a notable garden at Dangstein near Petersfield, where she cultivated orchids and pitcher-plants. Nevill was providing Darwin with samples of, and observations from, her garden. In Insectivorous Plants (1875) Darwin credited Lady Nevill with having sent him an Australian plant and a utricularia montana. In her Reminiscences, Nevill noted that she had maintained correspondence with Darwin, William Hooker, and Joseph Hooker, all of whom she felt had an avid interest in her garden Charles Dawrin needs no introduction. One of the most significant scientists of all time credited for his work on evolution and natural selection. Letters of such length and content rarely come up for sale. First and Fine.

FIRST EDITION, FIRST ISSUE OF THE AMERICAN PRINTING. RARE IN ORIGINAL CLOTH AND ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE. The copy is unrestored and unsophisticated, the hinges still in unusually nice condition as is the cloth of the covers. Darwin's Revolutionary Masterwork, in which he not only \"drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken.\" [PMM) Together with Copernicus' DE REVOLUTIONIBUS and Newton's PRINCIPIA, it is deemed one of the three greatest and most important scientific works ever penned. \"The most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" and \"The most important biological work ever written\" (Horblit, Freeman). Darwin's elaboration of the theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for the controversy over the evolution of man, and with only slight modification by such scientists as Stephen Jay Gould, Darwin's ideas remain the umbra under which most current biological research is conducted. Darwin had intended the book to be an abstract of his 'big book' on transmutation, of which only the first part (Variation Under Domestication, 1868) was published in his lifetime. The book comes from the Lee- Perkins - Shattuck - Peabody collection, a family line that is famous throughout New England.  Seller Inventory # 32188\n        Contact seller",

Overall, a superb copy in original cloth. Freeman 376. Darwin's On the Origin of Species is the basis for all of evolutionary biology. It includes evidence from Darwin's journey aboard the HMS Beagle, including data on the famous finches from the Galapagos Islands. First published in November 1859 with only 1,170 copies for sale, the book sold out in a single day. Just six weeks later, this second edition was printed, which contained many corrections and alterations. One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs. Additionally, in the final sentence of the book, Darwin incorporates a reference to \"the Creator.\".  Seller Inventory # CDAR015\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "S.-Peterburg, 1864. 8vo. Bound in a beautiful recent pastiche-binding of brown half calf with marbled papers over boards and elegant gilding to spine. End-papers renewed. A few dampstains and a bit of brownspotting throughout. A nice copy. XIV, 399, (1) pp. + 1 plate. Rare first edition of the first Russian translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\", a main reason for the widespread effect of Darwinism in Russia, where the theory met less resistance in the 1860'ies than it did in Western Europe. In Russia, Darwinism had a profound influence not only upon the different sciences, but also on philosophy, economic and political thought, and the great literature of the period. For instance, both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky referenced Darwin in their most important works, as did numerous other thinkers of the period.\"In 1864, S.A. Rachinsky, professor of plant physiology at St. Petersburg University, produced the first Russian translation of the \"Origin\". Although not a masterpiece of translation art, the book sold out so quickly that in 1865 it went through a second printing. By this time Darwin's ideas were discussed not only by scientists but also by such popular writers as Dmitri Pisarev and M. A. Antinovich.\" (Glick, p. 232). Rachinsky began translating the \"Origin\" in 1862 and wrote an important article on the theories presented in it, while working on the translation. This article and the translation of the \"Origin\" into Russian were responsible for the great success and rapid, widespread knowledge of Darwinian theory of evolution in Russia. \"Darwin was concerned that the \"Origin of Species\" reach naturalists across the world, but translations of that complicated work raised problems for Darwin. If he found it difficult to make the reader \"understand what is meant\" in England and America, at least in those two countries he and the reader were discussing the \"Origin of Species\" in the same language. Foreign language editions raised not only the thorny question of translating Darwinian terms, but also the problem of translators, who often thought it proper to annotate their editions to explain the \"significance\" of Darwinism. The first Russian translation of the \"Origin of Species\" (1864) appeared, however, without any comment whatever by the translator, Sergei A. Rachinsky, professor of botany at the University of Moscow. Rachinsky had begun the translation in 1862 and published an article on Darwinism while continuing work on the translation in 1863.\" (Rogers, p. 485). In the year of publication of the translation, 1864, Pisarev wrote a long article in \"The Russian Word\", which purports to be a review of this translation\" the critic complains about the absence of notes and commentaries by the translator. Pisarev furthermore points to several errors in the translation and to numerous infelicities of expression. Acknowledging the importance of the work, however, and of the spreading of Darwinism in Russia, he goes on in his own essay to provide a much more popular account of Darwin's theory and to impress upon his readers its revolutionary significance.Nikolai Strakhov also reviewed the translation immediately upon publication, acknowledging the effect it would have. Strakhov, however, recognized potential dangers inherent in the theory and expressed them in his review of Rachinsky's translation. He praised the work for its thoroughness and rejoiced in the evidence that man constituted the highest stage of organic development\" but then he went on to argue that by moving into questions of philosophy and theology, the Darwinists were exceeding the limits of scientific evidence. Like Pisarev, Tolstoy enthusiastically embraced Darwinism. \"The first mention of Darwin in Tolstoy's literary \"Nachlass\" is found in one of the drafts to \"War and Peace\". There Darwin is listed, apparently quite favorably, among leading thinkers \"working toward new truth\" [.] Thus by the late 1860's the name of Darwin as a leading scientist was already familia.

Reinforced in inner margins and plate with waterstains to lower margin. An unusually fine and well preserved copy, internally as well as externally. XV, 403 pp + 1 plate. Rare first edition of the first Italian translation of Darwin's seminal \"Origin of Species\", quite unusually, authorized by Darwin himself. The work was very well received and - compared to France and Spain - Darwinism was quickly adopted by Italian biologist and zoologist and meet only little catholic opposition. \"The impact of Darwinism on Italian naturalists was powerful\" the logic and rigorous treatment of the problem of the origin of species as Darwin had presented it, forced zoologists and anthropologists to reconsider those passages of Lamarckisms that they had agreed to with excessive enthusiasm\". (Capanna, Darwinism and the Italian academies). The reception of Darwin's work in France (1862) and Spain (1877) were characterized by a strong chatolic opposition, which also had a strong suppressing effect on the spread of his ideas to academic institutions.Despite of Italy being a catholic stronghold the reception of Darwinism was very favourable and meet very limited criticism from the church:\"In contrast to the power Catholicism was able to exert against Darwinism in Spain, it was practically impotent in Italy. Neither could the Italian Catholic intellectual establishment draw upon a repertory of anti-Darwinism arguments from the Italian scientific establishment, as was done in France. As in France under the Third Republic and as was the case sporadically in Spain, the advent of Darwinism in Italy provided a source of ideology for the anticlerical movement. Although Darwinism enjoyed a number of close connections with the English source, the peculiarities of the Italian situation set Darwinism in Italy apart from other situations. Italy was in the forefront in recognizing Darwin, electing him to various academies and societies and awarding him the famous Bressa Prize in 1875. In Italy the translation of the Origin \"1864\" was given an impeccable scientific presentation by Giocanni Canestrini and Leonardo Salimbeni, which avoided the type of situation that arose from the presentation of Darwinism in France by Cl\u00c3 mence Royer as a new scientific basis for a secularistic Weltanschauung. As a general explanation, of course, it is reasonable to accept Cermenati's arguments that the favorable receptivity of the scientific community and the general indifference to ecclesiastical objections to Darwinism are the chief factors explaining the quick spread of Darwinism in Italy\". (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism).Emma Darwin, Darwin's wife, wrote publisher John Murry on the 17th of December: \"Mr Darwin desires me to say that as you have never hesitated to authorize a foreign translation he has taken upon himself to authorise a translation into Italian without consulting you.\" When Darwin was informed that his work was being translated into Italian he wrote to his close friend J. D. Hooker: \"There is an Italian Edit. of Origin preparing!!! This makes fifth foreign Edit, ie in five foreign countries. Owen will not be right in telling Longmans that Book wd be utterly forgotten in ten years. Hurrah!\".Freeman no. 706.  Seller Inventory # 55760\n        Contact seller",

The translator L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Dapsy (1843-1890) was a gymnasium teacher in Budapest, who studied at the New College in The University of Edinburgh. While in Scotland Dapsy was introduced to Darwin's scientific theories, and back in Hungary, he became a pioneer advocate of Darwinism. As a member of the Hungarian Society of Natural Sciences Dapsy urged the publication of Darwin's works in Hungarian and translated the present book, On the Origin of Species. While working on the text, he was in correspondence with Darwin who, besides authorized the publication, provided the photograph after which the portrait, illustrating this edition, has been made. The translation was revised by another progressive Hungarian scientist and early Darwinist Tivadar Marg\u00f3 (1816-1896), who was the author of the first Hungarian zoological book based on Darwin's theories, and the first biography of Darwin written in Hungarian.

VIII (including half, 520, (6) pp + 1 plate. The very scarce first edition of the highly important first German translation, which appeared just months after the original.This translation came to play a tremendous role in the spreading of Darwinism in Germany and Northern Europe in general. It was through this translation that Darwinian thought reached most of the German scientists and thinkers of the period, and it was this translation that challenged German scholars to think in new ways about morphology, systematics, paleontology, and other biological disciplines. It was from this translation that Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's most famous nineteenth-century proponent and popularizer in Germany, got his Darwinism and was able to further spread the new ideas in his own country. The German translation of Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" appeared in 1860, just months after the original, thanks to Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished German paleontologist whose work in some ways paralleled Darwin's. Bronn's version of the book (with his own notes and commentary appended) did much to determine how Darwin's theory was understood and applied by German biologists, for the translation process involved more than the mere substitution of German words for English.\"Its [Origin of Species] greatest impact on German biological practice lay in the introduction of historical modes of explanation for the observable phenomena of living nature. The historical approach to nature was rejected, not only by the opponents of evolution, but also by the idealist evolutionist. Whether they favored a teleological or a reductionist biology, the idealists could not see the point of a theory that emphasized the irregularities and exceptions in the organic world. In the timeless real of idealist thinking, unchanging laws worked out an inevitable destiny. But Darwin taught his followers to look at living beings one by one. Thus prompted, they recognized, as if for the first time, the surprising fact of anomaly and the wisdom of an open-ended theory.\" (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism). \"Darwin was not happy about the first German translation. It was done from the second English edition by H.G. Bronn, who had, at Darwin's suggestion, added an appendix of the difficulties which occurred to him\" but he had also excised bits of which he did not approve. This edition also contains the historical sketch in its shorter and earlier form.\" (Freeman).Freeman No 672 - Freeman does not mention the lithographed plate.

Hindges weak and back board detached from bookblock. Verso of title-page and first leaf on content. 437, (1), XVI [Including the plate] pp. First edition of the first full Polish translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\". An attempt to publish a Polish translation was made as early as 1873. This was, however, never completed and only half of the work was published (Freeman 739), thus making the present copy the very first full Polish translation. As seen in several other countries (especially in Japan) the majority of Polish intellectuals adopted a Social Darwinism perspective at a very early stage, rather than appreciating the English naturalist's caution in applying his ideas to human society.\"Before the first translations of Darwin's appeared [.], many Polish intellectuals, such as positivist writer Eliza Orzeszkowa (1841-1910) complained about the increasing confusion over the essence of the English naturalist's ideas, which had all too often been mixed up with all sorts of ideological debates. However, when Darwin's books were actually available in Polish translations, the novelty of his concepts gradually wore off, making room for more serious attempts to come to terms with evolutionary theory.\" (Glick, The Reception of Charles Darwin in Europe). \"It appears that the struggle for or against Darwinism in partitioned Poland prefigured a pattern that is relevant for Polish thinking up to the present day: the conflict of striving for progress with the help of powerful allies abroad and of virulently rejecting all foreign advice for fear of losing one's cultural identity.\" (Ibid.).Translation was begun by Szymon Dickstein who in the processe of the translation committed suicide. It was completed by J\u00c3 zef Nusbaum who also translated 'The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' in 1888.Freeman 740.  Seller Inventory # 56005\n        Contact seller",

By then, Darwin was well aware that he had a phenomenon on his hands with the title - it was time to widen his audience. The 6th edition was purposefully set in smaller type, slimming the book's profile and making it more affordable (\"I have been told on authority which I can trust that [.] workmen club together to buy the Origin,\" Darwin noted of previous editions in correspondence in 1871). It also contains a glossary for the first time, making the text more accessible to a non-specialist audience. Appropriately, this copy was once owned by James G. Mead, whale biologist and longtime curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian. Mead is a particular proponent of the anatomical study of marine mammals, a method of examination that Darwin also favored; THE NEW YORK TIMES notes that Mead's use of this technique \"has given scientists a detailed look at species that often can be observed only fleetingly in the wild.\" A notable edition of an iconic work. 7.5'' x 5''.

Exceedingly Rare &amp; fragile French popular wrappered edition of Charles Darwin's, Origin of Species (1859). This wrappered \"populaire\" and \"quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition\" [fourth edition] of The Origin was based on the third French translation by Mlle. Royer. It was authorized by Darwin and incorporated the author's latest changes in his English imprints. Because French paper has always been problematic: tending to become brittle, chip, and disintegrate, this edition in wrappers is breathtakingly rare. The small paper label of \"M. Riquier, percepteur honoraire / S440 . . . PONT-de-METZ\" is pasted down inoffensively on lower portion of the half-title, below which there is his stamped name, \"M. Riquirer.\" This stereotyped edition incorporates the latest Additions by the Author [Charles Darwin] and Notes by the learned translator, Mammoiselle Royer, a self-described \"disciple de Lamar[c]k.\" Surprisingly, she refers in her Preface to this fourth edition to Darwin's death [in 1882] just as this edition was about to be published, and to twenty-three years having passed since the publication of his first edition in [1859}. This volume is thus a reissue of the Fourth French edition in wrappered format for popular consumption, which was to have appeared in 1882.coincidentally, the year in which her esteemed and communicative Charles Darwin had just died. This edition is not noted by R. B. Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin / An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, Second Edition (1977). Freeman identifies the Fourth French edition of L'Origin as #658: \"[ ] Paris, C. Marpon &amp; E Flammarion. I [not our Roman numeral \"L\" {i.e., 50-pages} expanded Preface] + 650 pp.\" Though Freeman notes #669 a two-volume Flammarion edition with 675 pp. that appeared in 1918 that was also translated by Mlle. Royer, he has no mention of this rarity; nor does the Fifth edition have any date, but closely resembles #658, the Fourth edition. We can, therefore, date this popular \"paperback\" [reissue of the fourth edition] to 1882, though it bears no date on its title page. The learned translator also refers to \"la Th\u00e9orie d'\u00e9volution par S\u00e9lection Naturelle\" as \"Darwinism,\" and to other works she had written: \"sur Lamarck, sa vie, ses travaux et ses doctrines {Revue de Philosophie positive, 1869-70), and her article Darwinism du Dictionnaire des sciences m\u00e9dicales.\" The front wrapper had two small holes in the middle of the title page which was also loose. These minor defects have been carefully restored and strengthened by Scott Kellar, our gifted bookbinder. (The front wrapper retains some discoloration and a rough fringe, while the paper backstrip has losses to its periphery.) Scott has also constructed a protective brown cloth-covered, sturdy clamshell case for this precious volume. Fourth Edition / \"Quatri\u00e8me Edition\" [French] reissued with expanded Preface.

    "description": "Tokyo, Tokyo Kaiseikan, Meiji 38 [1905]. 8vo. In the original full bloth cloth with gilt letteing (in both Japanese and Latin characters). Light occassional brownspotting, otherwise a fine copy. 4, 894, 28, 12 pp. + frontispiece and folded plate with genealogical tree. Rare second translation, and arguably the most important, of the Japanese translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" (the first being from 1896 and only published once). This is the first translation to be made by a professional biologist. The previous translation (\"Seibutsu Shigen\") was made by a law student which presumably was a contributing factor to the fact that the work primarily was embraced by social thinkers, philosophers and politicians to advocate the superiority of Japanese culture and society (and military) and not by biologist and zoologist. With the present translation Darwin's ideas and theories were finally properly introduced to the people they were intended for: biologist and zoologist. The popularity of Darwin's works and theories became immensly popular in Japan: \"Curiously, there are more versions of \"The Origin\" in Japanese than in any other language. The earliest were literary, with subsequent translations becoming more scientific as the Japanese developed a technical language for biology.\" (Glick, The Comparatice Reception of Darwinism, P. XXII).\"It was as if Darwin's famous oceanic journey and the meticulous research into the animal and plant kingdoms that he spent his life undertaking had all been staged as an elaborate excuse for composing a theory whose true object was Victorian society and the fate of the world's modern nations.\" (Golley, Darwinism in Japan: The Birth of Ecology).Darwin's work had in Japan - as in the rest of the world - profound influence on the academic disciplines of zoology and biology, however, in Japan the most immediate influence was not on these subjects but on social thinkers: \"[.] it exerted great influence on Japanese social thinkers and social activists. After learning of Darwin's theory, Hiroyuki Kato, the first president of Tokyo Imperial University, published his New Theory of Human Rights and advocated social evolution theory (social Darwinism), emphasizing the inevitable struggle for existence in human society. He criticized the burgeoning Freedom and People's right movement. Conversely Siusui Kautoku, a socialist and Japanese translator of the Communist Manifesto, wrote articles on Darwinism, such as \"Darwin and Marx\" (1904). In this and other articles, he criticized kato's theory on Social Darwinism, insisting that Darwinism does not contradict socialism. The well known anarchist, Sakae Osugi published the third translation of On the Origin of Species in 1914, and later his translation of peter Kropotokin's Mutial Aid: A Factor of Evolution. Osugi spread the idea of mutual aid as the philosophical base of Anarcho-syndicalism.\" (Tsuyoshi, The Japanese Lysenkoism and its Historical Backgrounds, p. 9) \"Charles Darwin's theory of evolution was introduced to Japan in 1877 (Morse 1936/1877) during Japan's push to gain military modernity through study of western sciences and technologies and the culture from which they had arisen. In the ensuing decades the theory of evolution was applied as a kind of social scientific tool, i.e. social Spencerism (or social Darwinism) (Sakura 1998:341\" Unoura 1999). Sakura (1998) suggests that the theory of evolution did not have much biological application in Japan. Instead, Japanese applied the idea of 'the survival of the fittest' (which was a misreading of Darwin's natural selection theory) to society and to individuals in the struggle for existence in Japan's new international circumstances (see also Gluck 1985: 13, 265).However, at least by the second decade of the 1900s, and by the time that Imanishi Kinji entered the Kyoto Imperial University, the curricula in the natural and earth sciences were largely based on German language sources and later on English lan.

VIII (including half, 520, (6) pp + 1 plate. The very scarce first edition of the highly important first German translation, which appeared just months after the original.This translation came to play a tremendous role in the spreading of Darwinism in Germany and Northern Europe in general. It was through this translation that Darwinian thought reached most of the German scientists and thinkers of the period, and it was this translation that challenged German scholars to think in new ways about morphology, systematics, paleontology, and other biological disciplines. It was from this translation that Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's most famous nineteenth-century proponent and popularizer in Germany, got his Darwinism and was able to further spread the new ideas in his own country. The German translation of Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" appeared in 1860, just months after the original, thanks to Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished German paleontologist whose work in some ways paralleled Darwin's. Bronn's version of the book (with his own notes and commentary appended) did much to determine how Darwin's theory was understood and applied by German biologists, for the translation process involved more than the mere substitution of German words for English.\"Its [Origin of Species] greatest impact on German biological practice lay in the introduction of historical modes of explanation for the observable phenomena of living nature. The historical approach to nature was rejected, not only by the opponents of evolution, but also by the idealist evolutionist. Whether they favored a teleological or a reductionist biology, the idealists could not see the point of a theory that emphasized the irregularities and exceptions in the organic world. In the timeless real of idealist thinking, unchanging laws worked out an inevitable destiny. But Darwin taught his followers to look at living beings one by one. Thus prompted, they recognized, as if for the first time, the surprising fact of anomaly and the wisdom of an open-ended theory.\" (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism). \"Darwin was not happy about the first German translation. It was done from the second English edition by H.G. Bronn, who had, at Darwin's suggestion, added an appendix of the difficulties which occurred to him\" but he had also excised bits of which he did not approve. This edition also contains the historical sketch in its shorter and earlier form.\" (Freeman).Freeman No 672 - Freeman does not mention the lithographed plate.

    "description": "PRESENTATION COPY OF DARWIN'S GREATEST WORK. First edition, presentation copy, of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" (Horblit), \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Freeman), and \"a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general\" (DSB). \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (PMM). Bern Dibner's Heralds of Science describes On the Origin of Species as \"the most important single work in science.\" When the first edition was published on 24 November 1859, in a print run of 1,250 copies, it created an immediate sensation. Fifty-eight were distributed by Murray for review, promotion, and presentation, and Darwin reported that the balance was sold out on the first day of publication. Five further editions, each variously corrected and revised, appeared in Darwin's lifetime, as did eleven translations. The Origin was actually an 'abstract' of a larger work, tentatively titled Natural Selection, that Darwin never completed, although he salvaged much of the first part of the manuscript for The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868. The presentation copies likely number less than 30, allhaving secretarial inscriptions and were sent by the publisherat Darwin's request. \"There are no known author's presentation copies of the first edition inscribed in Darwin's hand\" (Norman). Provenance: Inscribed in a secretarial hand 'Dr. Buist / Bombay / from the author' (as described in the list of presentation copies of the Origin in Vol 8, Appendix III, p 556 and further note on p 559). Dr. George Buist (1805-60) was a founding member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of St. Andres, of which Darwin was an 'Honorable Member'. After taking degrees at St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh, Buist left Scotland for a journalistic posting in India, where his scientific interests led him to serve as Secretary to the Bombay Geographical Society, the same role Darwin played for the London Geographical Society. Both men were fellows of the Royal Society. \"England became quieter and more prosperous in the 1850s, and by mid-decade the professionals were taking over, instituting exams and establishing a meritocracy. The changing social composition of science-typified by the rise of the freethinking biologist Thomas Henry Huxley-promised a better reception for Darwin. Huxley, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and other outsiders were opting for a secular nature in the rationalist Westminster Review and deriding the influence of \"parsondom.\" Darwin had himself lost the last shreds of his belief in Christianity with the tragic death of his oldest daughter, Annie, from typhoid in 1851 . \"After speaking to Huxley and Hooker at Downe in April 1856, Darwin began writing a triple-volume book, tentatively called Natural Selection, which was designed to crush the opposition with a welter of facts. Darwin now had immense scientific and social authority, and his place in the parish was assured when he was sworn in as a justice of the peace in 1857. Encouraged by Lyell, Darwin continued writing through the birth of his 10th and last child, Charles Waring Darwin (born in 1856, when Emma was 48), who was developmentally disabled. Whereas in the 1830s Darwin had thought that species remained perfectly adapted until the environment changed, he now believed that every new variation was imperfect, and that perpetual struggle was the rule. He also explained the evolution of sterile worker bees in 1857. Those could not be selected because they did not breed, so he opted for \"family\" selection (kin selection, as it is known today): the whole colony benefited from.

    "description": "Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Original handwritten and signed letter to Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill; written on his Down, Bromley, Kent stationary, dated 27 November [1861]. One sheet, four pages, 8vo (203 x 127 mm), on a bifolium. In the letter Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for providing him with a plethora of orchids. Thanks to her help Darwin was aided in his efforts to write On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects [1862] in which he further gave evidence for the theory provided in the landmark  On the Origin of Species [1859]. A lengthy letter in excellent condition with a beautiful signature and interesting content with direct link to his scientific work. Condition: in near fine condition with usual folding creases to fit an envelope. Content of the letter: A beautifull lengthy letter in which Darwin thanks Lady Nevill for her kindness and assistance in supplying him with plants, and mentioning his forthcoming work on orchids [On the Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are Fertilised by Insects, published in 1862] which he had promised to send her when it was published.  \u0085I am pleased to hear that my Books have at all interested you; but I fear my little Orchid book will be dry. This summer when at the sea, I meant merely to write a paper for some scientific journal, but the subject grew on me till my M.S. got rather too long for a paper. I am convinced that orchids have a wicked power of witchcraft, for I ought all these months to be working at the dry old bones of poultry, pigeons, and rabbits instead of intensely admiring beautiful orchids.   I mention all this, because, though I can hardly bear to write the words, I must beg your Ladyship not to send any more of your treasures; though perhaps at some future period I may indulge myself with the examination of a few more orchids.   I will not forget your Ladyships most generous offer to give me other flowers, if I require them for observation, &amp; I have no doubt that I shall some time be a beggar again of the beauties   I am truly obliged to your Ladyship for taking the truth to write to Mr. Veitch [Chelsea nursery firm of James Veitch]; who has already sent me some orchids &amp; with much generosity refused all payment for cut flowers.   I see in  Cottage Gardner  of this morning, an account of the beauties of Dangstein, which I shall now read with interest.  Darwin also sends his regards to naturalist Arthur Edward Knox and paleontologist Sir Philip Egerton:  If your Ladyship should meet Mr [Arthur Edward] Knox I hope that you will remember me to him: I spent many years ago a very pleasant morning with him &amp; Sir Philip Egerton at the Zoological Gardens\u0085  In a postscript he adds:  Since writing I have reason to hope that I shall receive a flower of Mormodes from Mr Rucker of Wandsworth . Lady Dorothy Fanny Nevill (1826-1913), the daughter of Horatio Walpole, 3rd Earl of Orford, developed a notable garden at Dangstein near Petersfield, where she cultivated orchids and pitcher-plants. Nevill was providing Darwin with samples of, and observations from, her garden. In Insectivorous Plants (1875) Darwin credited Lady Nevill with having sent him an Australian plant and a utricularia montana. In her Reminiscences, Nevill noted that she had maintained correspondence with Darwin, William Hooker, and Joseph Hooker, all of whom she felt had an avid interest in her garden Charles Dawrin needs no introduction. One of the most significant scientists of all time credited for his work on evolution and natural selection. Letters of such length and content rarely come up for sale. First and Fine.

FIRST EDITION, FIRST ISSUE OF THE AMERICAN PRINTING. RARE IN ORIGINAL CLOTH AND ONE OF THE GREATEST BOOKS IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE. The copy is unrestored and unsophisticated, the hinges still in unusually nice condition as is the cloth of the covers. Darwin's Revolutionary Masterwork, in which he not only \"drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken.\" [PMM) Together with Copernicus' DE REVOLUTIONIBUS and Newton's PRINCIPIA, it is deemed one of the three greatest and most important scientific works ever penned. \"The most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" and \"The most important biological work ever written\" (Horblit, Freeman). Darwin's elaboration of the theory of natural selection laid the groundwork for the controversy over the evolution of man, and with only slight modification by such scientists as Stephen Jay Gould, Darwin's ideas remain the umbra under which most current biological research is conducted. Darwin had intended the book to be an abstract of his 'big book' on transmutation, of which only the first part (Variation Under Domestication, 1868) was published in his lifetime. The book comes from the Lee- Perkins - Shattuck - Peabody collection, a family line that is famous throughout New England.  Seller Inventory # 32188\n        Contact seller",

Overall, a superb copy in original cloth. Freeman 376. Darwin's On the Origin of Species is the basis for all of evolutionary biology. It includes evidence from Darwin's journey aboard the HMS Beagle, including data on the famous finches from the Galapagos Islands. First published in November 1859 with only 1,170 copies for sale, the book sold out in a single day. Just six weeks later, this second edition was printed, which contained many corrections and alterations. One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs. Additionally, in the final sentence of the book, Darwin incorporates a reference to \"the Creator.\".  Seller Inventory # CDAR015\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "S.-Peterburg, 1864. 8vo. Bound in a beautiful recent pastiche-binding of brown half calf with marbled papers over boards and elegant gilding to spine. End-papers renewed. A few dampstains and a bit of brownspotting throughout. A nice copy. XIV, 399, (1) pp. + 1 plate. Rare first edition of the first Russian translation of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\", a main reason for the widespread effect of Darwinism in Russia, where the theory met less resistance in the 1860'ies than it did in Western Europe. In Russia, Darwinism had a profound influence not only upon the different sciences, but also on philosophy, economic and political thought, and the great literature of the period. For instance, both Tolstoy and Dostoevsky referenced Darwin in their most important works, as did numerous other thinkers of the period.\"In 1864, S.A. Rachinsky, professor of plant physiology at St. Petersburg University, produced the first Russian translation of the \"Origin\". Although not a masterpiece of translation art, the book sold out so quickly that in 1865 it went through a second printing. By this time Darwin's ideas were discussed not only by scientists but also by such popular writers as Dmitri Pisarev and M. A. Antinovich.\" (Glick, p. 232). Rachinsky began translating the \"Origin\" in 1862 and wrote an important article on the theories presented in it, while working on the translation. This article and the translation of the \"Origin\" into Russian were responsible for the great success and rapid, widespread knowledge of Darwinian theory of evolution in Russia. \"Darwin was concerned that the \"Origin of Species\" reach naturalists across the world, but translations of that complicated work raised problems for Darwin. If he found it difficult to make the reader \"understand what is meant\" in England and America, at least in those two countries he and the reader were discussing the \"Origin of Species\" in the same language. Foreign language editions raised not only the thorny question of translating Darwinian terms, but also the problem of translators, who often thought it proper to annotate their editions to explain the \"significance\" of Darwinism. The first Russian translation of the \"Origin of Species\" (1864) appeared, however, without any comment whatever by the translator, Sergei A. Rachinsky, professor of botany at the University of Moscow. Rachinsky had begun the translation in 1862 and published an article on Darwinism while continuing work on the translation in 1863.\" (Rogers, p. 485). In the year of publication of the translation, 1864, Pisarev wrote a long article in \"The Russian Word\", which purports to be a review of this translation\" the critic complains about the absence of notes and commentaries by the translator. Pisarev furthermore points to several errors in the translation and to numerous infelicities of expression. Acknowledging the importance of the work, however, and of the spreading of Darwinism in Russia, he goes on in his own essay to provide a much more popular account of Darwin's theory and to impress upon his readers its revolutionary significance.Nikolai Strakhov also reviewed the translation immediately upon publication, acknowledging the effect it would have. Strakhov, however, recognized potential dangers inherent in the theory and expressed them in his review of Rachinsky's translation. He praised the work for its thoroughness and rejoiced in the evidence that man constituted the highest stage of organic development\" but then he went on to argue that by moving into questions of philosophy and theology, the Darwinists were exceeding the limits of scientific evidence. Like Pisarev, Tolstoy enthusiastically embraced Darwinism. \"The first mention of Darwin in Tolstoy's literary \"Nachlass\" is found in one of the drafts to \"War and Peace\". There Darwin is listed, apparently quite favorably, among leading thinkers \"working toward new truth\" [.] Thus by the late 1860's the name of Darwin as a leading scientist was already familia.

Rare first edition of the first Italian translation of Darwin's seminal \"Origin of Species\", quite unusually, authorized by Darwin himself. The work was very well received and - compared to France and Spain - Darwinism was quickly adopted by Italian biologist and zoologist and meet only little catholic opposition. \"The impact of Darwinism on Italian naturalists was powerful\" the logic and rigorous treatment of the problem of the origin of species as Darwin had presented it, forced zoologists and anthropologists to reconsider those passages of Lamarckisms that they had agreed to with excessive enthusiasm\". (Capanna, Darwinism and the Italian academies). The reception of Darwin's work in France (1862) and Spain (1877) were characterized by a strong chatolic opposition, which also had a strong suppressing effect on the spread of his ideas to academic institutions.Despite of Italy being a catholic stronghold the reception of Darwinism was very favourable and meet very limited criticism from the church:\"In contrast to the power Catholicism was able to exert against Darwinism in Spain, it was practically impotent in Italy. Neither could the Italian Catholic intellectual establishment draw upon a repertory of anti-Darwinism arguments from the Italian scientific establishment, as was done in France. As in France under the Third Republic and as was the case sporadically in Spain, the advent of Darwinism in Italy provided a source of ideology for the anticlerical movement. Although Darwinism enjoyed a number of close connections with the English source, the peculiarities of the Italian situation set Darwinism in Italy apart from other situations. Italy was in the forefront in recognizing Darwin, electing him to various academies and societies and awarding him the famous Bressa Prize in 1875. In Italy the translation of the Origin \"1864\" was given an impeccable scientific presentation by Giocanni Canestrini and Leonardo Salimbeni, which avoided the type of situation that arose from the presentation of Darwinism in France by Cl\u00c3 mence Royer as a new scientific basis for a secularistic Weltanschauung. As a general explanation, of course, it is reasonable to accept Cermenati's arguments that the favorable receptivity of the scientific community and the general indifference to ecclesiastical objections to Darwinism are the chief factors explaining the quick spread of Darwinism in Italy\". (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism).Emma Darwin, Darwin's wife, wrote publisher John Murry on the 17th of December: \"Mr Darwin desires me to say that as you have never hesitated to authorize a foreign translation he has taken upon himself to authorise a translation into Italian without consulting you.\" When Darwin was informed that his work was being translated into Italian he wrote to his close friend J. D. Hooker: \"There is an Italian Edit. of Origin preparing!!! This makes fifth foreign Edit, ie in five foreign countries.

VIII (including half, 520, (6) pp + 1 plate. The very scarce first edition of the highly important first German translation, which appeared just months after the original.This translation came to play a tremendous role in the spreading of Darwinism in Germany and Northern Europe in general. It was through this translation that Darwinian thought reached most of the German scientists and thinkers of the period, and it was this translation that challenged German scholars to think in new ways about morphology, systematics, paleontology, and other biological disciplines. It was from this translation that Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's most famous nineteenth-century proponent and popularizer in Germany, got his Darwinism and was able to further spread the new ideas in his own country. The German translation of Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" appeared in 1860, just months after the original, thanks to Heinrich Georg Bronn, a distinguished German paleontologist whose work in some ways paralleled Darwin's. Bronn's version of the book (with his own notes and commentary appended) did much to determine how Darwin's theory was understood and applied by German biologists, for the translation process involved more than the mere substitution of German words for English.\"Its [Origin of Species] greatest impact on German biological practice lay in the introduction of historical modes of explanation for the observable phenomena of living nature. The historical approach to nature was rejected, not only by the opponents of evolution, but also by the idealist evolutionist. Whether they favored a teleological or a reductionist biology, the idealists could not see the point of a theory that emphasized the irregularities and exceptions in the organic world. In the timeless real of idealist thinking, unchanging laws worked out an inevitable destiny. But Darwin taught his followers to look at living beings one by one. Thus prompted, they recognized, as if for the first time, the surprising fact of anomaly and the wisdom of an open-ended theory.\" (Glick, The Comparative Reception of Darwinism). \"Darwin was not happy about the first German translation. It was done from the second English edition by H.G. Bronn, who had, at Darwin's suggestion, added an appendix of the difficulties which occurred to him\" but he had also excised bits of which he did not approve.

    "description": "203 x 121 mm. (8 x 5\"). All volumes with ads at the end. Two separately published works in three volumes. Publisher's brown buckram, covers with black-stamped frames, flat spines with gilt titling, \"Origin\" with a leaves uncut in a couple of places. Descent with 76 illustrations in the text; \"Origin\" with folding diagram. Front free endpaper of all three volumes with pencilled signature of L. G. Andrews. Freeman 942, 394. Tiny tear to head of one spine, one corner slightly bumped, extremities lightly rubbed, a little chafing to a couple of boards, one page with faint printing smudges, other trivial internal imperfections, but FINE COPIES, internally clean and fresh, in sound bindings with few signs of use. The first edition of \"Descent of Man\" is especially notable for Darwin's first use of the word now virtually synonymous with his name: \"evolution\" appears on p. 2 of volume I, noting the opposition of some older scholars of natural science to his theory of natural selection. Darwin considered \"descent\" a continuation of the other work here, his ground-breaking \"Origin of Species,\" with special focus on man's descent from ape-like creatures. As DNB notes, \"'Descent' of Man brought the full force of evolutionary proposals directly into the heart of ordinary Victorian life.\" Another area of controversy in \"Descent\" was Darwin's theory on sexual selection, which he used to explain physical characteristics more aesthetic than functional, such as the male peacock's splendid tail, the male hummingbird's iridescence, and the male human's beard--all features that might give the possessor advantage in the attraction of a mate. Widely considered the most important biological book ever written, \"Origin\" went through six revised editions following its first appearance in 1859, with our fifth edition marking Darwin's first use of Herbert Spencer's phrase \"survival of the fittest\" to describe natural selection. Our copy has never been read all the way through--a couple of leaves that remained uncut by the binder are still attached, and no one has attempted to open them. Copies of these editions appear on the market from time to time, but not often in the little-used condition seen here. First American Edition of \"Descent\" (with first use of the word \"evolution\" by Darwin), later issue without errata; Fifth Edition of \"Origin.\".

    "description": "8vo (7 1/4\" x ~5\"), green wrappers, French text ncorporates authorized corrections by the Author [Charles Darwin] &amp; additional notes by the translator, Mlle. Cl\u00e9mence-Auguste Royer; L-page Pr\u00e9face [containing the Advertissement Aux Lecteurs Pr\u00e9face De La Quatri\u00e8me Edition, Pr\u00e9face De La Premi\u00e8re \u00c9dition, &amp; Notice Historique] + 650-pages. Exceedingly Rare &amp; fragile French popular wrappered edition of Charles Darwin's, Origin of Species (1859). This wrappered \"populaire\" and \"quatri\u00e8me \u00e9dition\" [fourth edition] of The Origin was based on the third French translation by Mlle. Royer. It was authorized by Darwin and incorporated the author's latest changes in his English imprints. Because French paper has always been problematic: tending to become brittle, chip, and disintegrate, this edition in wrappers is breathtakingly rare. The small paper label of \"M. Riquier, percepteur honoraire / S440 . . . PONT-de-METZ\" is pasted down inoffensively on lower portion of the half-title, below which there is his stamped name, \"M. Riquirer.\" This stereotyped edition incorporates the latest Additions by the Author [Charles Darwin] and Notes by the learned translator, Mammoiselle Royer, a self-described \"disciple de Lamar[c]k.\" Surprisingly, she refers in her Preface to this fourth edition to Darwin's death [in 1882] just as this edition was about to be published, and to twenty-three years having passed since the publication of his first edition in [1859}. This volume is thus a reissue of the Fourth French edition in wrappered format for popular consumption, which was to have appeared in 1882.coincidentally, the year in which her esteemed and communicative Charles Darwin had just died. This edition is not noted by R. B. Freeman, The Works of Charles Darwin / An Annotated Bibliographical Handlist, Second Edition (1977). Freeman identifies the Fourth French edition of L'Origin as #658: \"[ ] Paris, C. Marpon &amp; E Flammarion. I [not our Roman numeral \"L\" {i.e., 50-pages} expanded Preface] + 650 pp.\" Though Freeman notes #669 a two-volume Flammarion edition with 675 pp. that appeared in 1918 that was also translated by Mlle. Royer, he has no mention of this rarity; nor does the Fifth edition have any date, but closely resembles #658, the Fourth edition. We can, therefore, date this popular \"paperback\" [reissue of the fourth edition] to 1882, though it bears no date on its title page. The learned translator also refers to \"la Th\u00e9orie d'\u00e9volution par S\u00e9lection Naturelle\" as \"Darwinism,\" and to other works she had written: \"sur Lamarck, sa vie, ses travaux et ses doctrines {Revue de Philosophie positive, 1869-70), and her article Darwinism du Dictionnaire des sciences m\u00e9dicales.\" The front wrapper had two small holes in the middle of the title page which was also loose. These minor defects have been carefully restored and strengthened by Scott Kellar, our gifted bookbinder. (The front wrapper retains some discoloration and a rough fringe, while the paper backstrip has losses to its periphery.) Scott has also constructed a protective brown cloth-covered, sturdy clamshell case for this precious volume. Fourth Edition / \"Quatri\u00e8me Edition\" [French] reissued with expanded Preface.

The lower end of each spine has the remnants of a small white sticker indicative of a private owner's attempts to catalog their own library. A handsome, early edition of a seminal work of science.

Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, is a work of scientific literature which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.

    "description": "On the Origin of Species is a book that changed the way we think about the development of life on earth. The author's controversial theory of natural selection, or survival of the fittest, would make him internationally famous and put the issue of evolution at the centre of a fierce debate which still rages some 150 years after the book's first publication. This clothbound edition includes over one hundred delicately detailed and informative contemporary illustrations, many of them relating to the discoveries Darwin made during the second voyage of the research ship, H.M.S. Beagle. A truly beautiful and highly collectible edition in its own slipcase.",

    "description": "In The Origin of Species (1859) Darwin challenged many of the most deeply-held beliefs of the Western world. Arguing for a material, not divine, origin of species, he showed that new species are achieved by \"natural selection.\" The Origin communicates the enthusiasm of original thinking in an open, descriptive style, and Darwin's emphasis on the value of diversity speaks more strongly now than ever. As well as a stimulating introduction and detailed notes, this edition offers a register of the many writers referred to by Darwin in the text.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.",

    "description": "The notable fifth edition of Charles Darwin's influential 'On the Origin of Species', this edition is important because it is the first time that Darwin uses the term 'survival of the fittest'. Illustrated with a folding plate. The fifth edition, tenth thousandth of this work, an edition of two-thousand copies.This fifth edition is notable, as it was the first time the phrase 'survival of the fittest' was included. The phrase had been coined by the philosopher Herbert Spencer in his 1864 work 'Principles of Biology'. The term is used first in the heading of Chapter IV.Illustrated with one folding graph, facing plate 132.Sixteen pages of adverts to the rear, dated January 1871.?Half-title is present.Collated, complete.Rebacked with new endpapers.?'On the Origin of Species' is one of the most influential works on science ever published, this work considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology, and thus caused controversy upon its publication. To this day, it remains one of the most important biological works ever published. The work introduces Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, at a time when the theory of creation was the standard. It was written for a general audience, and though is naturally involves scientific ideas, it was popular with non-specialist readers.Some of the evidence Darwin gives in this work comes from his research undertaken on his surveys on the H.M.S. Beagle, and the ideas that were hinted at in his work 'The Voyage of the Beagle'.Despite the controversy, or perhaps because of it, 'On the Origin of Species' gained international interest, and started a wide debate on creation versus evolution. Some of those against the work included the bishop Samuel Wilberforce, who wrote a negative review on the work.Among the contemporary reception of this work, there was a debate in Oxford in 1860 including Thomas Huxley, Samuel Wilberforce, Robert FitzRoy, and Benjamin Brodie, all debating the subject of evolution. It is often known as the Huxley-Wilberforce debate. The debate is best remembered for the moment in which Wilberforce, during a heated exchange, asked Huxley whether it was through his grandmother or grandfather that he claimed his descent from a monkey. In a full rebacked cloth binding, with the original boards and spine restored, and new endpapers. Externally, mart. Light bumping to the extremities. Very light rubbing to the boards and spine. Only a couple of small marks to the boards. Spots to the fore edge. Internally, firmly bound. Pages are generally bright with some scattered spots, mostly to the first and last few pages.

    "description": "Charles Darwin's seminal formulation of the theory of Evolution, On the Origin of Species continues to be as controversial today as when it was first published. Written for a general readership, On the Origin of Species sold out on the day of its publication and has remained in print ever since. Instantly and persistently controversial, the concept of natural selection transformed scientific analysis about all life on Earth. Before\u00a0the Origin of Species, accepted thinking held that life was the static and perfect creation of God. By a single, systematic argument Darwin called this view into question. His ideas have affected public perception of everything from religion to economics. William Bynum's introduction discusses Darwin's life, the publication and reception of the themes of On the Origin of Species, and the subsequent development of its major themes. The new edition also includes brief biographies of some of the most important scientific thinkers leading up to and surrounding the Origin of Species, suggested further reading, notes and a chronology.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700\u00a0titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

In the 1872 sixth edition \"On\" was omitted, so the full title is The origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life. This edition is usually known as The Origin of Species. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution. Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research, correspondence, and experimentation.",

    "description": "PRESENTATION COPY OF DARWIN'S GREATEST WORK. First edition, presentation copy, of \"the most influential scientific work of the nineteenth century\" (Horblit), \"the most important biological work ever written\" (Freeman), and \"a turning point, not only in the history of science, but in the history of ideas in general\" (DSB). \"Darwin not only drew an entirely new picture of the workings of organic nature; he revolutionized our methods of thinking and our outlook on the natural order of things. The recognition that constant change is the order of the universe had been finally established and a vast step forward in the uniformity of nature had been taken\" (PMM). Bern Dibner's Heralds of Science describes On the Origin of Species as \"the most important single work in science.\" When the first edition was published on 24 November 1859, in a print run of 1,250 copies, it created an immediate sensation. Fifty-eight were distributed by Murray for review, promotion, and presentation, and Darwin reported that the balance was sold out on the first day of publication. Five further editions, each variously corrected and revised, appeared in Darwin's lifetime, as did eleven translations. The Origin was actually an 'abstract' of a larger work, tentatively titled Natural Selection, that Darwin never completed, although he salvaged much of the first part of the manuscript for The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, published in 1868. The presentation copies likely number less than 30, allhaving secretarial inscriptions and were sent by the publisherat Darwin's request. \"There are no known author's presentation copies of the first edition inscribed in Darwin's hand\" (Norman). Provenance: Inscribed in a secretarial hand 'Dr. Buist / Bombay / from the author' (as described in the list of presentation copies of the Origin in Vol 8, Appendix III, p 556 and further note on p 559). Dr. George Buist (1805-60) was a founding member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of St. Andres, of which Darwin was an 'Honorable Member'. After taking degrees at St. Andrews and the University of Edinburgh, Buist left Scotland for a journalistic posting in India, where his scientific interests led him to serve as Secretary to the Bombay Geographical Society, the same role Darwin played for the London Geographical Society. Both men were fellows of the Royal Society. \"England became quieter and more prosperous in the 1850s, and by mid-decade the professionals were taking over, instituting exams and establishing a meritocracy. The changing social composition of science-typified by the rise of the freethinking biologist Thomas Henry Huxley-promised a better reception for Darwin. Huxley, the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and other outsiders were opting for a secular nature in the rationalist Westminster Review and deriding the influence of \"parsondom.\" Darwin had himself lost the last shreds of his belief in Christianity with the tragic death of his oldest daughter, Annie, from typhoid in 1851 . \"After speaking to Huxley and Hooker at Downe in April 1856, Darwin began writing a triple-volume book, tentatively called Natural Selection, which was designed to crush the opposition with a welter of facts. Darwin now had immense scientific and social authority, and his place in the parish was assured when he was sworn in as a justice of the peace in 1857. Encouraged by Lyell, Darwin continued writing through the birth of his 10th and last child, Charles Waring Darwin (born in 1856, when Emma was 48), who was developmentally disabled. Whereas in the 1830s Darwin had thought that species remained perfectly adapted until the environment changed, he now believed that every new variation was imperfect, and that perpetual struggle was the rule. He also explained the evolution of sterile worker bees in 1857. Those could not be selected because they did not breed, so he opted for \"family\" selection (kin selection, as it is known today): the whole colony benefited from.

    "description": "Sixth edition (\"forty-third thousand\") - and the first edition to use the term \"evolution\" to describe the mechanism of natural selection that Darwin introduced in the book. \"Evolution\" - the word now most associated with THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES - did not appear in the publication until the sixth edition. By then, Darwin was well aware that he had a phenomenon on his hands with the title - it was time to widen his audience. The 6th edition was purposefully set in smaller type, slimming the book's profile and making it more affordable (\"I have been told on authority which I can trust that [.] workmen club together to buy the Origin,\" Darwin noted of previous editions in correspondence in 1871). It also contains a glossary for the first time, making the text more accessible to a non-specialist audience. Appropriately, this copy was once owned by James G. Mead, whale biologist and longtime curator of marine mammals at the Smithsonian. Mead is a particular proponent of the anatomical study of marine mammals, a method of examination that Darwin also favored; THE NEW YORK TIMES notes that Mead's use of this technique \"has given scientists a detailed look at species that often can be observed only fleetingly in the wild.\" A notable edition of an iconic work. 7.5'' x 5''.

Upon its publication, the book began to transform attitudes about society and religion, and was soon used to justify the philosophies of communists, socialists, capitalists, and even Germany's National Socialists.

It includes evidence from Darwin's journey aboard the HMS Beagle, including data on the famous finches from the Galapagos Islands. First published in November 1859 with only 1,170 copies for sale, the book sold out in a single day. Just six weeks later, this second edition was printed, which contained many corrections and alterations. One of the biggest changes Darwin made was to a section on the hypothetical evolutionary relationship between whales and bears that had been misinterpreted by some and used to criticize the book and Darwin's theory. Darwin also made alterations to the book's conclusion to diffuse outrage from religious figures. He adds the sentence \"I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious views of anyone\" and references a letter from author and clergyman Charles Kingsley, of The Water-Babies fame, in which Kingsley praises Darwin and says that his theory poses no threat to his personal religious beliefs. Additionally, in the final sentence of the book, Darwin incorporates a reference to \"the Creator.\".  Seller Inventory # CDAR015\n        Contact seller",
