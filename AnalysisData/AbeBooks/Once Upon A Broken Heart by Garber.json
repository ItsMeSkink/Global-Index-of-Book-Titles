After being swept up in the magical world of Caraval, Donatella Dragna has finally escaped her father and saved her sister Scarlett from a disastrous arranged marriage. The girls should be celebrating, but Tella isn't yet free. She made a desperate bargain with a mysterious criminal, and what Tella owes him no one has ever been able to deliver: Caraval Master Legend's true name.

Create and learn new skills and knacks that are tailored specifically to you and your character. No two characters of any race and career combination will ever be the same. *Featuring over 20 different races and nearly 50 career paths. *Introducing BattleBoard Combat: a one-of-a-kind way to track initiative and keep combat flowing smoothly and without interruption or delay. *For the first time ever, experience the Mote Advancement Experiment (MAX), which rewards characters for incredible roleplaying rather than number of kills and puts the responsibility for such awards in the hands of the players, as well as the Lorekeeper.",

Desperate to stop the wedding and to heal her wounded heart, Evangeline strikes a deal with the charismatic, but wicked, Prince of Hearts. In exchange for his help, he asks for three kisses, to be given at the time and place of his choosing. But after Evangeline's first promised kiss, she learns that bargaining with an immortal is a dangerous game -- and that the Prince of Hearts wants far more from her than she'd pledged.
