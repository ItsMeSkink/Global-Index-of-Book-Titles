The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development. This work has been developed to serve all sections of people - the large body of students, researchers and general readers.  Seller Inventory # 136222A\n        Contact seller",

The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development. This work has been developed to serve all sections of people - the large body of students, researchers and general readers.  Seller Inventory # 136222A\n        Contact seller",

The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development.

The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development. This work has been developed to serve all sections of people - the large body of students, researchers and general readers.  Seller Inventory # 136222A\n        Contact seller",

The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development. This work has been developed to serve all sections of people - the large body of students, researchers and general readers.  Seller Inventory # 136222A\n        Contact seller",

The existing literature largely highlights the linear pattern of his life, but the evolution of his life and thoughts through different phases of his varied life with a number of turning points is scantly dealt with. Our present work is analytical in nature. It analyses the evolution of the life of Swami Vivekananda along with some important turning points. It also discusses the perspectives of Swami Vivekananda, his philosophy of life and education, and his development approaches. Some of his literary living works as a litterateur and his notable teachings are also presented for the sake of understanding his contributions as an outstanding saint. In this work we study the life, philosophy and teachings of Swami Vivekananda as an evolution through the lens of his own works, through his voice, which would serve as a luminous inspiration for human development. This work has been developed to serve all sections of people - the large body of students, researchers and general readers.  Seller Inventory # 136222A\n        Contact seller",
