Now this beautifully illustrated book will inspire more readers to ask for help, help others, and discover their own courage through a charming story about change. \u00a0 Life is a series of choices. Do we go left or right? Jump forward or hold back? \u00a0 Sometimes our choices work out for the better...and sometimes they don\u2019t. But there is one choice, regardless of every other decision, that profoundly affects how we feel about our journey: Do we go alone or do we go together? \u00a0 It is the courageous few who ask for help. It is the giving few willing to help others. We can all find the courage we need and know the joy of service \u2013 the minute we learn that together is better. \u00a0 Filled with inspiring quotes, this richly illustrated fable tells a delightful story of three kids who go on a journey to a new playground and take a stand for what they believe. The story is a metaphor for anyone looking to make a change or wondering how to pursue their dreams. And the message is simple: relationships \u2013 real, human relationships \u2013 really, really matter. The stronger our relationships, the stronger the bonds of trust and cooperation, the more we can accomplish and the more joy and fulfillment we get from our work and personal lives. \u00a0 The three heroes are archetypes who represent us all at various points in our lives. Their main challenge is the same one we face every day: How can we find the things we\u2019re looking for? According to Sinek, if we each do our part to help advance a shared vision, we can build the world we imagine.  \u00a0 In addition to the story itself, Sinek shares such profound lessons as:\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00b7 A team is not a group of people that work together. A team is a group of people that trust each other. \u00a0 \u00b7 Fight against something and we focus on the thing we hate. Fight for something and we focus on the thing we love. \u00a0 \u00b7 Working hard for something we don\u2019t care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion.  \u00a0 \u00b7 A star wants to see himself rise to the top. A leader wants to see those around him become stars.  \u00a0Together is Better was designed to be given as a gift to someone you want to inspire, or to say thank you to someone who inspires you. It's completely different from Sinek's previous work. It may look like a children's book, but it's definitely for adults.This book includes a special page featuring the Scent of Optimism.", "isbn": 9781591847854, "publisher": "Portfolio, 2016", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781591847854-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=31463009061&searchurl=an%3Dsimon%2Bsinek%26sortby%3D17&cm_sp=snippet-_-srp1-_-title1"}, {"title": "Together Is Better", "subtitle": "A Little Book of Inspiration - Hardcover", "authors": ["Sinek", "Simon"], "description": "Simon Sinek sparked a movement with his bestsellers START WITH WHY and LEADERS EAT LAST.

Now with an expanded chapter and appendix on leading millennials, based on Simon Sinek's viral video \"Millenials in the workplace\" (150+ million views).Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled. This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful organizations, great leaders create environments in which people naturally work together to do remarkable things.\u00a0In his work with organizations around the world, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams trust each other so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each other. Other teams, no matter what incentives are offered, are doomed to infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why?The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general. \"Officers eat last,\" he said. Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior Marines took their place at the back of the line. What's symbolic in the chow hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: Great leaders sacrifice their own comfort--even their own survival--for the good of those in their care.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too many workplaces are driven by cynicism, paranoia, and self-interest. But the best ones foster trust and cooperation because their leaders build what Sinek calls a \"Circle of Safety\" that separates the security inside the team from the challenges outside.Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating true stories that range from the military to big business, from government to investment banking.", "isbn": 9781591845324, "publisher": "Portfolio/Penguin, New York, 2014", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781591845324-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/signed-first-edition/Leaders-Eat-Last-Why-Teams-Pull/31476719568/bd"}, {"title": "Leaders Eat Last", "subtitle": "Why Some Teams Pull Together and Others Don't", "authors": ["Simon Sinek"], "description": "BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.", "isbn": 9780670923168, "publisher": "Portfolio Penguin, 1900", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780670923168-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/Leaders-Eat-Last-Why-Teams-Pull/22696652642/bd"}, {"title": "Together Is Better", "subtitle": "A Little Book of Inspiration - Hardcover", "authors": ["Sinek", "Simon"], "description": "Simon Sinek sparked a movement with his bestsellers START WITH WHY and LEADERS EAT LAST. Now this beautifully illustrated book will inspire more readers to ask for help, help others, and discover their own courage through a charming story about change. \u00a0 Life is a series of choices. Do we go left or right? Jump forward or hold back? \u00a0 Sometimes our choices work out for the better...and sometimes they don\u2019t. But there is one choice, regardless of every other decision, that profoundly affects how we feel about our journey: Do we go alone or do we go together? \u00a0 It is the courageous few who ask for help. It is the giving few willing to help others. We can all find the courage we need and know the joy of service \u2013 the minute we learn that together is better. \u00a0 Filled with inspiring quotes, this richly illustrated fable tells a delightful story of three kids who go on a journey to a new playground and take a stand for what they believe. The story is a metaphor for anyone looking to make a change or wondering how to pursue their dreams. And the message is simple: relationships \u2013 real, human relationships \u2013 really, really matter. The stronger our relationships, the stronger the bonds of trust and cooperation, the more we can accomplish and the more joy and fulfillment we get from our work and personal lives. \u00a0 The three heroes are archetypes who represent us all at various points in our lives. Their main challenge is the same one we face every day: How can we find the things we\u2019re looking for? According to Sinek, if we each do our part to help advance a shared vision, we can build the world we imagine.  \u00a0 In addition to the story itself, Sinek shares such profound lessons as:\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00b7 A team is not a group of people that work together. A team is a group of people that trust each other. \u00a0 \u00b7 Fight against something and we focus on the thing we hate. Fight for something and we focus on the thing we love. \u00a0 \u00b7 Working hard for something we don\u2019t care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion.  \u00a0 \u00b7 A star wants to see himself rise to the top. A leader wants to see those around him become stars.  \u00a0Together is Better was designed to be given as a gift to someone you want to inspire, or to say thank you to someone who inspires you. It's completely different from Sinek's previous work. It may look like a children's book, but it's definitely for adults.This book includes a special page featuring the Scent of Optimism.", "isbn": 9781591847854, "publisher": "Portfolio", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781591847854-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/9781591847854/Together-Better-Little-Book-Inspiration-1591847850/plp"}, {"title": "Find Your Why - Softcover", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Simon Sinek"], "description": "Simon Sinek's recent video on 'The Millennial Question' went viral with over 150 million views.

Now this beautifully illustrated book will inspire more readers to ask for help, help others, and discover their own courage through a charming story about change. \u00a0 Life is a series of choices. Do we go left or right? Jump forward or hold back? \u00a0 Sometimes our choices work out for the better...and sometimes they don\u2019t. But there is one choice, regardless of every other decision, that profoundly affects how we feel about our journey: Do we go alone or do we go together? \u00a0 It is the courageous few who ask for help. It is the giving few willing to help others. We can all find the courage we need and know the joy of service \u2013 the minute we learn that together is better. \u00a0 Filled with inspiring quotes, this richly illustrated fable tells a delightful story of three kids who go on a journey to a new playground and take a stand for what they believe. The story is a metaphor for anyone looking to make a change or wondering how to pursue their dreams. And the message is simple: relationships \u2013 real, human relationships \u2013 really, really matter. The stronger our relationships, the stronger the bonds of trust and cooperation, the more we can accomplish and the more joy and fulfillment we get from our work and personal lives. \u00a0 The three heroes are archetypes who represent us all at various points in our lives. Their main challenge is the same one we face every day: How can we find the things we\u2019re looking for? According to Sinek, if we each do our part to help advance a shared vision, we can build the world we imagine.  \u00a0 In addition to the story itself, Sinek shares such profound lessons as:\u00a0  \u00a0 \u00b7 A team is not a group of people that work together. A team is a group of people that trust each other. \u00a0 \u00b7 Fight against something and we focus on the thing we hate. Fight for something and we focus on the thing we love. \u00a0 \u00b7 Working hard for something we don\u2019t care about is called stress. Working hard for something we love is called passion.  \u00a0 \u00b7 A star wants to see himself rise to the top. A leader wants to see those around him become stars.  \u00a0Together is Better was designed to be given as a gift to someone you want to inspire, or to say thank you to someone who inspires you. It's completely different from Sinek's previous work. It may look like a children's book, but it's definitely for adults.This book includes a special page featuring the Scent of Optimism.", "isbn": 9781591847854, "publisher": "Portfolio, 2016", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781591847854-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/Together-Better-Little-Book-Inspiration-Sinek/30142644331/bd"}, {"title": "Empieza con el porque / Start With Why", "subtitle": "Como Los Grandes Lideres Motivan a Actuar", "authors": ["Sinek", "Simon"], "description": "Para Sinek, lo importante no es tanto que es lo que haces como el por que lo haces.

Finite games, like football or chess, have known players, fixed rules and a clear endpoint. The winners and losers are easily identified. Infinite games, games with no finish line, like business or politics, or life itself, have players who come and go. The rules of an infinite game are changeable while infinite games have no defined endpoint.

David Marquet ]A new model for leadership from a former Navy captain who transformed his command. -- David Marquet, an experienced Navy officer, was used to giving orders. As newly appointed captain of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, he was responsible for more than a hundred sailors. In this high-stress environment, where there is no margin for error, it was crucial his men did their job and did it well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance, and the worst crew retention in the fleet. -- Marquet acted like any other captain until, one day, he unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. When he asked why the order wasn't challenged, the answer was ''Because you told me to.'' Marquet realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things. -- That's when Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Turn the Ship Around! is the true story of how the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet by challenging the US Navy's traditional leader-follower approach. Struggling against his own instincts to take control, he instead achieved the vastly more powerful model of giving control. -- Before long, each member of Marquet's crew became a leader and assumed responsibility for everything he did, from clerical tasks to crucial combat decisions. The crew became fully engaged, contributing their full intellectual capacity every day, and the Santa Fe started winning awards and promoting a highly disproportionate number of officers to submarine command. -- No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet's radical guidelines to turn your own ship around. The payoff? -- a workplace where everyone around you is taking responsibility for their actions, where people are healthier and happier, where everyone is a leader.", "isbn": 9781469027463, "publisher": "Gildan Media and AudioGO", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9781469027463-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/9781469027463/Turn-Ship-Around-True-Story-1469027461/plp"}, {"title": "The Ignorant Maestro", "subtitle": "How Great Leaders Inspire Unpredictable Brilliance - Softcover", "authors": ["Talgam", "Itay"], "description": "In The Ignorant Maestro, Symphony Orchestra conductor Itay Talgam reveals the art of successful leadership by looking at the world's greatest conductorsA conductor in front of his orchestra is an iconic symbol of leadership.

Are you sacrificing your family, friendships, and freedom to keep your business alive?  What if instead your business could run itself, freeing you to do what you love when you want, while it continues to grow and turn a profit?It's possible. And it's easier than you think. If you're like most entrepreneurs, you started your business so you could be your own boss, make the money you deserve, and live life on your own terms. In reality, you're bogged down in the daily grind, constantly putting out fires, answering an endless stream of questions, and continually hunting for cash. Now, Mike Michalowicz, the author of Profit First and other small-business bestsellers, offers a straightforward step-by-step path out of this dilemma. In Clockwork, he draws on more than six years of research and real life examples to explain his simple approach to making your business ultra-efficient.Among other powerful strategies, you will discover how to:* Make your employees act like owners: Free yourself from micromanaging by using a simple technique to empower your people to make smart decisions without you. * Pinpoint your business's most important function: Unleash incredible efficiency by identifying and focusing everyone on the one function that is most crucial to your business. * Know what to fix next: Most entrepreneurs try to fix every inefficiency at once and end up fixing nothing. Use the \"weakest link in the chain\" method to find the one fix that will add the most value now. Whether you have a staff of one, one hundred, or somewhere in between, whether you're a new entrepreneur or have been overworked and overstressed for years, Clockwork is your path to finally making your business work for you.", "isbn": 9786073174091, "publisher": "Conecta, 2019", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/inventory/md/md30315915109.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/sistema-Clockwork-Disena-negocio-funcione-relojito/30315915109/bd"}, {"title": "The Power of WOW", "subtitle": "How to Electrify Your Work and Your Life by Putting Service First - Hardcover", "authors": ["The Employees Of Zappos.Com; Hsieh", "Tony; Dagostino", "Mark"], "description": "Happy customers.
