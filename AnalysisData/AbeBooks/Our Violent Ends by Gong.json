'Deliciously dark' Natasha Ngan, New York Times bestselling author of Girls of Paper and FireIn glittering Shanghai, a monster awakens . . .The brilliantly imaginative New York Times bestselling fantasy retelling of Romeo and Juliet set against the immersive backdrop of 1920s Shanghai.A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city in the grip of chaos. At its heart is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang - a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette's first love . . . and first betrayal.But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns - and grudges - aside and work together, for if they can't stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.Filled with romance, intrigue and betrayal, this heart-stopping debut is perfect for fans of The Last Magician and Descendant of the Crane.'Heady, smart, and vicious' Tessa Gratton, author of The Queens of Innis Lear'Deliciously dark' Natasha Ngan, New York Times bestselling author of Girls of Paper and Fire'Dark and beautiful' Emiko Jean, author of Empress of all Seasons'A terrific, deliciously unputdownable read' June Hur, author of The Silence of Bones Shipping may be from multiple locations in the US or from the UK, depending on stock availability.

The definition of which quickly evolved to mean any book with the words of Chairman bound in the iconic red vinyl - pocket-size book. Mao's words, poetry &amp; sayings were exceptionally respected and taken quite literally by the Hong Wei Bing [Red Guards], who were steadfast Zhong chen [loyal] followers of all things Mao and the Wen Hua Da Geming [Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976], to the extreme. . The book's popularity may be because it was essentially an unofficial requirement for every Chinese citizen to own, to read, and to carry it at all times during the latter half of Mao's rule, especially during the Wen Hua Da Geming. . *** THE SIZE &amp; FORMAT: The most widely produced editions of the Quotations of Chairman Mao as well as several other titles were published with a gold-stamped, printed red vinyl cover wrapper, most included a frontispiece of Mao [in sepia or color], followed by an essay by Lin Biao in red Hanzi [Chinese Characters. Other editions of the book were covered in cloth, silk, leather, paper, and other varied materials. Most editions were produced in a functional, compact size that fitted into a pocket, easy to carry, and could be taken out at any time. Some Hong Wei Bing youth carried \"Little Red Books \" in red tiny red-cotton cloth shoulder bags with yellow stenciled designs and texts. During the Wen Hua Da Geming, \"Red Books\" were the single most visible icon, even more visible than the image of Chairman Mao himself. In posters and pictures created by CPC's [Communist Party of China] propaganda artists, nearly every painted character, whether smiling or looking determined, was seen with a copy of the book in his or her hand. . Mao officially ended the Wenv Hua De Geming in 1969, but its active phase lasted until 1971. With the death of Mao on September 9. 1976, the end of the Wen Hua Da Geming wound down and was eventually 'banned' and forcefully shut down by the PLA [People's Liberation Army] often in violent and deadly ways. With the rise of Deng Xiaoping in 1978, the importance of the \"Red Book\" waned, and the glorification of Mao's quotations was considered to be left deviationism and a cult of personality. . Inside the first fly leaf is one of Mao's most famous expressions: \"WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE\" . *** A NOTE ABOUT LIN BIAO [1907-1971]: Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong's cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death. Mao appointed Lin to be in charge of the Wen Hua De Geming, therefore his words and essays were commonly found in most \"Red Books\" from that time. . Lin Biao fled and died in a plane crash, accused of plotting to overthrow Mao. After Mao's death and the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976, Deng Xiao.

The book was printed in large quantities until Mao's death in 1976; by the late 1970s, however, a change of government meant further circulation of the book was discouraged, with millions of copies were collected and destroyed. His Little Red Book, however, sometimes referred to as the \"Chinese Bible\", \"forms a brilliant compilation that is still readable and admired today for its political theories and strategies\" (ibid., p. 57).

JUST MENTION IMAGECODE IN THE REMARKS FIELD AT THE TIME OF PLACING ORDER. An instant #1 New York Times bestseller! Shanghai is under siege in this captivating and searingly romantic sequel to These Violent Delights, which New York Times bestselling author Natasha Ngan calls \"deliciously dark.\" The year is 1927, and Shanghai teeters on the edge of revolution. After sacrificing her relationship with Roma to protect him from the blood feud, Juliette has been a girl on a mission. One wrong move, and her cousin will step in to usurp her place as the Scarlet Gang's heir. The only way to save the boy she loves from the wrath of the Scarlets is to have him want her dead for murdering his best friend in cold blood. If Juliette were actually guilty of the crime Roma believes she committed, his rejection might sting less. Roma is still reeling from Marshall's death, and his cousin Benedikt will barely speak to him. Roma knows it's his fault for letting the ruthless Juliette back into his life, and he's determined to set things right--even if that means killing the girl he hates and loves with equal measure. Then a new monstrous danger emerges in the city, and though secrets keep them apart, Juliette must secure Roma's cooperation if they are to end this threat once and for all. Shanghai is already at a boiling point: The Nationalists are marching in, whispers of civil war brew louder every day, and gangster rule faces complete annihilation. Roma and Juliette must put aside their differences to combat monsters and politics, but they aren't prepared for the biggest threat of all: protecting their hearts from each other.

JUST MENTION IMAGECODE IN THE REMARKS FIELD AT THE TIME OF PLACING ORDER. An Instant New York Times Bestseller! A BuzzFeed Best Young Adult Book of 2020 Perfect for fans of The Last Magician and Serpent &amp; Dove, this heart-stopping debut is an imaginative Romeo and Juliet retelling set in 1920s Shanghai, with rival gangs and a monster in the depths of the Huangpu River. The year is 1926, and Shanghai hums to the tune of debauchery. A blood feud between two gangs runs the streets red, leaving the city helpless in the grip of chaos. At the heart of it all is eighteen-year-old Juliette Cai, a former flapper who has returned to assume her role as the proud heir of the Scarlet Gang--a network of criminals far above the law. Their only rivals in power are the White Flowers, who have fought the Scarlets for generations. And behind every move is their heir, Roma Montagov, Juliette's first love.and first betrayal. But when gangsters on both sides show signs of instability culminating in clawing their own throats out, the people start to whisper. Of a contagion, a madness. Of a monster in the shadows. As the deaths stack up, Juliette and Roma must set their guns--and grudges--aside and work together, for if they can't stop this mayhem, then there will be no city left for either to rule.

ABOUT THIS BOOK: From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of These Violent Delights and Our Violent Ends comes the first book in a captivating new duology following an ill-matched pair of spies posing as a married couple to investigate a series of brutal murders in 1930s Shanghai. It's 1931 in Shanghai, and the stage is set for a new decade of intrigue. Four years ago, Rosalind Lang was brought back from the brink of death, but the strange experiment that saved her also stopped her from sleeping and aging\u00e2 \"and allows her to heal from any wound. In short, Rosalind cannot die. Now, desperate for redemption for her traitorous past, she uses her abilities as an assassin for her country. Code name: Fortune. But when the Japanese Imperial Army begins its invasion march, Rosalind's mission pivots. A series of murders is causing unrest in Shanghai, and the Japanese are under suspicion. Rosalind's new orders are to infiltrate foreign society and identify the culprits behind the terror plot before more of her people are killed. To reduce suspicion, however, she must pose as the wife of another Nationalist spy, Orion Hong, and though Rosalind finds Orion's cavalier attitude and playboy demeanor infuriating, she is willing to work with him for the greater good. But Orion has an agenda of his own, and Rosalind has secrets that she wants to keep buried. As they both attempt to unravel the conspiracy, the two spies soon find that there are deeper and more horrifying layers to this mystery than they ever imagined.(Publisher).

We will rebind this book after purchasing from the original Publisher/Distributor. Two girls on opposite sides of a war discover they're fighting for a common purpose?and falling for each other?in Zoe Hana Mikuta's high-octane debut Gearbreakers, perfect for fans of Pacific Rim, Pierce Brown's Red Rising Saga, and Marie Lu's Legend series. We went past praying to deities and started to build them instead. The shadow of Godolia's tyrannical rule is spreading, aided by their giant mechanized weapons known as Windups. War and oppression are everyday constants for the people of the Badlands, who live under the thumb of their cruel Godolia overlords. Eris Shindanai is a Gearbreaker, a brash young rebel who specializes in taking down Windups from the inside. When one of her missions goes awry and she finds herself in a Godolia prison, Eris meets Sona Steelcrest, a cybernetically enhanced Windup pilot. At first Eris sees Sona as her mortal enemy, but Sona has a secret: She has intentionally infiltrated the Windup program to destroy Godolia from within. As the clock ticks down to their deadliest mission yet, a direct attack to end Godolia's reign once and for all, Eris and Sona grow closer?as comrades, friends, and perhaps something more.

JUST MENTION IMAGECODE IN THE REMARKS FIELD AT THE TIME OF PLACING ORDER. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - A princess in exile, a shapeshifting dragon, six enchanted cranes, and an unspeakable curse. Drawing from fairy tales and East Asian folklore, this original fantasy from the author of Spin the Dawn is perfect for fans of Shadow and Bone. A dazzling fairytale full of breathtaking storytelling. --Stephanie Garber, New York Times bestselling author of Caraval Shiori'anma, the only princess of Kiata, has a secret. Forbidden magic runs through her veins. Normally she conceals it well, but on the morning of her betrothal ceremony, Shiori loses control. At first, her mistake seems like a stroke of luck, forestalling the wedding she never wanted. But it also catches the attention of Raikama, her stepmother. A sorceress in her own right, Raikama banishes the young princess, turning her brothers into cranes. She warns Shiori that she must speak of it to no one: for with every word that escapes her lips, one of her brothers will die. Penniless, voiceless, and alone, Shiori searches for her brothers, and uncovers a dark conspiracy to seize the throne. Only Shiori can set the kingdom to rights, but to do so she must place her trust in a paper bird, a mercurial dragon, and the very boy she fought so hard not to marry. And she must embrace the magic she's been taught all her life to forswear--no matter what the cost. Weaving together elements of The Wild Swans, Cinderella, the legend of Chang E, and the Tale of the Bamboo Cutter, Elizabeth Lim has crafted a fantasy like no other, and one that will stay with readers long after they've turned the last page. A stunning remake of a fairytale. Six Crimson Cranes is the perfect blend of whimsy and ferociousness, with twists and turns that will tug at your heartstrings. --Chloe Gong, New York Times bestselling author of These Violent Delights Fast-paced excitement is balanced with a satisfyingly intricate plot that weaves in elements from Western fairy tales and East Asian folklore. --SLJ, starred review \"A richly imagined landscape . . . vibrant, fast-paced.\"--Publishers Weekly, starred review Language: English.
