But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him \u201cThe Fittest (Real) Man in America.\u201dIn Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

Sempre que somos tragados pelos dramas da vida, tanto os grandes quanto os pequenos, esquecemos que, por pior que a dor se torne, tudo que \u00e9 ruim tem um fim.\"   David GogginsA inf\u00e2ncia de David Goggins foi um pesadelo. Pobreza, racismo e maus-tratos f\u00edsicos marcaram seus dias, assombraram suas noites e quase determinaram seu futuro.Por meio da disciplina, da resist\u00eancia mental e do trabalho duro, o jovem deprimido e obeso que havia perdido as esperan\u00e7as deu a volta por cima, aprendeu a dominar a pr\u00f3pria mente e se transformou em um \u00edcone das For\u00e7as Armadas e um dos maiores atletas de resist\u00eancia do mundo.\u00danico homem a completar o treinamento de tr\u00eas das principais for\u00e7as de elite americanas e se tornar Navy SEAL, Army Ranger e especialista da Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Goggins tamb\u00e9m bateu recordes em ultramaratonas e eventos de resist\u00eancia.Neste livro, ele compartilha sua surpreendente hist\u00f3ria de vida e revela que a maioria das pessoas utiliza apenas uma parte da pr\u00f3pria capacidade f\u00edsica e mental.De acordo com sua Regra dos 40%, quando pensamos que j\u00e1 atingimos nosso limite, ainda dispomos de uma grande reserva desconhecida de energia   e, para acess\u00e1-la, s\u00f3 precisamos vencer a batalha dentro da nossa pr\u00f3pria mente.Seu relato inspirador ilumina o caminho que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode trilhar para superar a dor, demolir o medo e alcan\u00e7ar n\u00edveis in\u00e9ditos de desempenho e excel\u00eancia no esporte e na vida.; 409 pages.

    "description": "For David Goggins, childhood was a nightmare - poverty, prejudice, and physical abuse colored his days and haunted his nights. But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him The Fittest (Real) Man in America.\u00a0In Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",

Pobreza, racismo e maus-tratos f\u00edsicos marcaram seus dias, assombraram suas noites e quase determinaram seu futuro.Por meio da disciplina, da resist\u00eancia mental e do trabalho duro, o jovem deprimido e obeso que havia perdido as esperan\u00e7as deu a volta por cima, aprendeu a dominar a pr\u00f3pria mente e se transformou em um \u00edcone das For\u00e7as Armadas e um dos maiores atletas de resist\u00eancia do mundo.\u00danico homem a completar o treinamento de tr\u00eas das principais for\u00e7as de elite americanas e se tornar Navy SEAL, Army Ranger e especialista da Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Goggins tamb\u00e9m bateu recordes em ultramaratonas e eventos de resist\u00eancia.Neste livro, ele compartilha sua surpreendente hist\u00f3ria de vida e revela que a maioria das pessoas utiliza apenas uma parte da pr\u00f3pria capacidade f\u00edsica e mental.De acordo com sua Regra dos 40%, quando pensamos que j\u00e1 atingimos nosso limite, ainda dispomos de uma grande reserva desconhecida de energia   e, para acess\u00e1-la, s\u00f3 precisamos vencer a batalha dentro da nossa pr\u00f3pria mente.Seu relato inspirador ilumina o caminho que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode trilhar para superar a dor, demolir o medo e alcan\u00e7ar n\u00edveis in\u00e9ditos de desempenho e excel\u00eancia no esporte e na vida.; 409 pages.

But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him \u201cThe Fittest (Real) Man in America.\u201dIn Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities.

Sempre que somos tragados pelos dramas da vida, tanto os grandes quanto os pequenos, esquecemos que, por pior que a dor se torne, tudo que \u00e9 ruim tem um fim.\"   David GogginsA inf\u00e2ncia de David Goggins foi um pesadelo. Pobreza, racismo e maus-tratos f\u00edsicos marcaram seus dias, assombraram suas noites e quase determinaram seu futuro.Por meio da disciplina, da resist\u00eancia mental e do trabalho duro, o jovem deprimido e obeso que havia perdido as esperan\u00e7as deu a volta por cima, aprendeu a dominar a pr\u00f3pria mente e se transformou em um \u00edcone das For\u00e7as Armadas e um dos maiores atletas de resist\u00eancia do mundo.\u00danico homem a completar o treinamento de tr\u00eas das principais for\u00e7as de elite americanas e se tornar Navy SEAL, Army Ranger e especialista da Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP), Goggins tamb\u00e9m bateu recordes em ultramaratonas e eventos de resist\u00eancia.Neste livro, ele compartilha sua surpreendente hist\u00f3ria de vida e revela que a maioria das pessoas utiliza apenas uma parte da pr\u00f3pria capacidade f\u00edsica e mental.De acordo com sua Regra dos 40%, quando pensamos que j\u00e1 atingimos nosso limite, ainda dispomos de uma grande reserva desconhecida de energia   e, para acess\u00e1-la, s\u00f3 precisamos vencer a batalha dentro da nossa pr\u00f3pria mente.Seu relato inspirador ilumina o caminho que voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m pode trilhar para superar a dor, demolir o medo e alcan\u00e7ar n\u00edveis in\u00e9ditos de desempenho e excel\u00eancia no esporte e na vida.; 409 pages.

But through self-discipline, mental toughness, and hard work, Goggins transformed himself from a depressed, overweight young man with no future into a U.S. Armed Forces icon and one of the world's top endurance athletes. The only man in history to complete elite training as a Navy SEAL, Army Ranger, and Air Force Tactical Air Controller, he went on to set records in numerous endurance events, inspiring Outside magazine to name him \u201cThe Fittest (Real) Man in America.\u201dIn Can't Hurt Me, he shares his astonishing life story and reveals that most of us tap into only 40% of our capabilities. Goggins calls this The 40% Rule, and his story illuminates a path that anyone can follow to push past pain, demolish fear, and reach their full potential.",
