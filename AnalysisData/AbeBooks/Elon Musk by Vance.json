Su nombre es Elon Musk, y es el empresario que est\u00e1 detr\u00e1s de Tesla Motors, SpaceX y SolarCity, empresas innovadoras en sus respectivos campos \u2015la automovil\u00edstica, la aeron\u00e1utica y la energ\u00eda\u2015 con las que Musk est\u00e1 consiguiendo hacer realidad lo que hasta hace poco no era m\u00e1s que ciencia ficci\u00f3n Nacido en Sud\u00e1frica, Musk tuvo una infancia dif\u00edcil de ni\u00f1o prodigio con la mirada puesta en Estados Unidos. En cuanto pudo, cruz\u00f3 medio mundo para estudiar en Pennsylvania. Vendi\u00f3 la primera empresa que cre\u00f3, Zip2, por 300 millones de d\u00f3lares, y la segunda PayPal, por 1,500. A partir de ese momento, empez\u00f3 a so\u00f1ar a lo grande: coches el\u00e9ctricos a precios asequibles, cohetes espaciales, colonias en Marte, un tren capaz de circular a 1,200 kil\u00f3metros por hora, bater\u00edas de litio en las que almacenar energ\u00eda y poder prescindir de las el\u00e9ctricas...

A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy.\" \"In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation - all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon Must arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soard to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle -- and even revolutionize -- three industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic and intellectual powerhous.

A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy.\" \"In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation - all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon Must arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soard to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle -- and even revolutionize -- three industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic and intellectual powerhous. Elon Musk is a brilliant, penetrating examination of what Musk's career menas for a technology industry undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste of what could be an incredible century ahead.\" -- from the inner front and rear jacket flaps.

A modern alloy of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs, Musk is the man behind PayPal, Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and SolarCity, each of which has sent shock waves throughout American business and industry. More than any other executive today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as a science fiction fantasy.\" \"In this lively, investigative account, veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life and times of Silicon Valley's most audacious businessman. Written with exclusive access to Musk, his family, and his friends, the book traces his journey from his difficult upbringing in South Africa to his ascent to the pinnacle of the global business world. Vance spent more than fifty hours in conversation with Musk and interviewed close to three hundred people to tell the tumultuous stories of Musk's world-changing companies and to paint a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation - all while making plenty of enemies along the way. In 1992, Elon Must arrived in the United States as a ferociously driven immigrant bent on realizing his wildest dreams. Since then, Musk's roller-coaster life has brought him grave disappointments alongside massive successes. After being forced out of PayPal, fending off a life-threatening case of malaria, and dealing with the death of his infant son, Musk abandoned Silicon Valley for Los Angeles. He spent the next few years baffling his friends by blowing his entire fortune on rocket ships and electric cars. Cut to 2012, however, and Musk had mounted one of the greatest resurrections in business history: Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity had enjoyed unparalleled success, and Musk's net worth soard to more than $5 billion. At a time when many American companies are more interested in chasing easy money than in taking bold risks on radical new technology, Musk stands out as the only businessman with enough dynamism and vision to tackle -- and even revolutionize -- three industries at once. Vance makes the case that Musk's success heralds a return to the original ambition and invention that made America an economic and intellectual powerhous. Elon Musk is a brilliant, penetrating examination of what Musk's career menas for a technology industry undergoing dramatic change and offers a taste of what could be an incredible century ahead.\" -- from the inner front and rear jacket flaps.

More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.", "isbn": 9780062301239, "publisher": "Ecco", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780062301239-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/9780062301239/Elon-Musk-Tesla-SpaceX-Quest-0062301233/plp"}, {"title": "Elon Musk / Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future / Ashlee Vance", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Ashlee Vance:"], "description": "402 Seiten Sprache: Englisch Gewicht in Gramm: 338.

More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.", "isbn": 9780062301239, "publisher": "Ecco", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780062301239-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/9780062301239/Elon-Musk-Tesla-SpaceX-Quest-0062301233/plp"}, {"title": "Rocket Billionaires", "subtitle": "Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and the New Space Race", "authors": ["Fernholz", "Tim"], "description": "Featured on NPR and PBS\u2019s SciTech Now, and in Fast Company, Forbes, and the Wall Street Journal \u00a0The inside story of the new race to conquer space \u00a0 For the outsize personalities staking their fortunes on spaceships, the new race to explore space could be a dead end, a lucrative opportunity\u2014or the key to humanity\u2019s survival. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos take center stage in this fast-paced narrative as they attempt to disrupt the space economy and feed their own egos.

The personal tale of Musk's life comes with all the trappings one associates with a great, drama-filled story. He was a freakishly bright kid who was bullied brutally at school, and abused by his father. In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties. He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was forced out as CEO and so began his lost years in which he decided to go it alone and baffled friends by investing his fortune in rockets and electric cars. Meanwhile Musk's marriage disintegrated as his technological obsessions took over his life . Elon Musk is the Steve Jobs of the present and the future, and for the past twelve months, he has been shadowed by tech reporter, Ashlee Vance. Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of Spacex and Tesla is Shaping our Future is an important, exciting and intelligent account of the real-life Iron Man. The book has been read, but is in excellent condition. Pages are intact and not marred by notes or highlighting. The spine remains undamaged.

But things change when Sila accompanies her father (who is a mechanic) outside their Oregon town to fix a truck. There, behind an enormous stone wall, she meets a grandfatherly man who only months before won the state lottery. Their new alliance leads to the rescue of a circus elephant named Veda, and then to a friendship with an unusual boy named Mateo, proving that comfort and hope come in the most unlikely of places.

Pagel (* 14. Januar 1961 in Duisburg) ist ein deutscher Zoologe. Seit 2006 ist er Direktor des K\u00f6lner Zoos. Pagel studierte in an der Universit\u00e4t Duisburg, sp\u00e4ter an der Heinrich-Heine-Universit\u00e4t D\u00fcsseldorf Biologie, Geographie und P\u00e4dagogik auf Lehramt. Er schrieb seine Abschlussarbeit in Zoologie zum Thema Verhaltensstudien an Pinselzungenpapageien. Seit 1991 ist Pagel beim K\u00f6lner Zoo angestellt. Die dortige Einrichtung gilt als besonders progressiv. Pagel arbeitete zun\u00e4chst als Kurator f\u00fcr V\u00f6gel, Nagetiere, Huftiere, Raubtiere sowie das Tropenhaus. Zwischen April und Dezember 2002 leitete er zus\u00e4tzlich kommissarisch das Aquarium. Als Kurator gelangen ihm einige au\u00dferordentliche Nachzuchten, so u. a. die Zucht von Zwergpinguinen oder der asiatischen Schmuckpitta. F\u00fcr den Zuchtbericht Keeping and breeding of the Elegant Pitta \u00fcber letztere Vogelart erhielt er 2000 den Dulcie Cook Award der Avicultural Society. Pagel gr\u00fcndete das Europ\u00e4ische Erhaltungszuchtprogramm (EEP) f\u00fcr den Balistar (Leucopsar rothschildi) und f\u00fcr das Europ\u00e4ische Zuchtbuch (ESB) des Erzloris (Lorius domicella). Von 1999 bis 2007 leitete er das von ihm gestartete Naturschutzprojekt in Phong Nha-Ke Bang in Vietnam, in dem er 2004 gemeinsam mit der Zoologischen Gesellschaft Frankfurt (ZGF) und dem Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC) in Cuc Phuong, Vietnam, ein Programm zur Auswilderung von Primaten initiierte. Pagel wurde 2007 Nachfolger Gunther Nogges als K\u00f6lner Zoodirektor.[2] Gemeinsam mit seinem Vorstandskollegen Christopher Landsberg modernisierte er den K\u00f6lner Zoo und baute ihn aus. Ziel ist es, den Besuchern moderne Unterhaltungs- und Freizeitangebote mit hohem Erlebniswert zu bieten, die p\u00e4dagogisch zeitgem\u00e4\u00df f\u00fcr den Wert und Erhalt einer intakten Natur und Umwelt sensibilisieren. So er\u00f6ffnete 2010 der Hippodom, der einer afrikanischen Flusslandschaft nachempfunden ist, und 2014 der Clemenshof mit Streichelzoo. Auch die Anlagen f\u00fcr die Gro\u00dfen Ameisenb\u00e4ren, die Bantengs und die Roten Pandas, Zoorestaurant, Zooshop und Zooschule sowie der Spielplatz wurden in Pagels Amtszeit neu gebaut. Pagel hat seit 2007 einen Lehrauftrag an der Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln inne. 2016 wurde er von der Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftlichen Fakult\u00e4t der Universit\u00e4t zu K\u00f6ln zum Honorarprofessor ernannt.[3] Au\u00dferdem ist er als Sachverst\u00e4ndiger t\u00e4tig, so u. a. f\u00fcr das Bundesamt f\u00fcr Naturschutz und das Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Ern\u00e4hrung und Landwirtschaft. Pagel ist Mitglied der Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG) und der Asian Elephant Specialist Group (AsESG) der Weltnaturschutzunion (IUCN). Pagel ist verheiratet und hat zwei Kinder.[4] Verbandsarbeit Er wurde im November 2019 im argentinischen Buenos Aires zum Pr\u00e4sidenten der World Association of Zoos and Aquaria (WAZA) gew\u00e4hlt. Theo Pagel steht damit an der Spitze des einflussreichen Dachverbands aller wissenschaftlich gef\u00fchrten Zoos der Welt. Zu seinen Hauptzielen z\u00e4hlt es, die rund 700 Millionen Menschen weltweit, die pro Jahr zoologische G\u00e4rten besuchen, noch st\u00e4rker f\u00fcr Umwelt- und Naturschutz und den Erhalt der Artenvielfalt zu sensibilisieren. Er will den Ausbau international abgestimmter Erhaltungszuchtprogramme vorantreiben und die Standards von Zoos noch st\u00e4rker vereinheitlichen. Ein weiteres Ziel ist es, Zoos bei der wachsenden Zusammenarbeit mit internationalen Naturschutzorganisationen eine noch st\u00e4rkere Stimme zu geben. Seine Arbeit f\u00fcr den K\u00f6lner Zoo setzt er uneingeschr\u00e4nkt fort. Pagel ist au\u00dferdem im Vorstand der European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). Im Verband der Zoologischen G\u00e4rten (VdZ) war Pagel von 2013 bis 2016 Pr\u00e4sident. W\u00e4hrend seiner VdZ-Pr\u00e4sidentschaft verlagerte er den Sitz der Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle ins Berliner Haus der Bundespressekonferenz und stellte den Verband zusammen mit seinen VdZ-Vorstandskollegen inhaltlich und personell neu auf.

La visite du sultan des indes sur son elephant \u00e0 voyager dans le temps, Illustriert von Quentin Faucompr\u00e9. Aus dem Franz. von Werner Leonhard , Im Jahre 1900 wird ein unerh\u00f6rt reicher indischer Sultan von Tr\u00e4umen geplagt, in denen jedesmal ein riesengro\u00dfes M\u00e4dchen eine Rolle spielt. Er wird keine Ruhe finden, bevor er das M\u00e4dchen nicht gefunden hat; er muss in Raum und Zeit nach ihm suchen. Ein genialer Ingenieur konstruiert f\u00fcr ihn einen Elefanten, halb Tier und halb Maschine, in dem man durch beide Dimensionen reisen kann. 1905 beginnt die Reise des Sultans mit seinem Hofstaat und der Mannschaft, die den Elefanten bedient. Sie wird zu einer aufregenden Odyssee voller ungeahnter Begegnungen und drohender Katastrophen. Die Reise f\u00fchrt von Indien aus \u00fcber Land, unter Wasser und durch die Luft bis nach Europa. Und vom Jahr 1905 bis ins Jahr 2009 in Berlin, wo sich der Sultan und das riesige kleine M\u00e4dchen endlich begegnen werden .

The only problem is that he's still in good health, and in one day, he turns 100. A big celebration is in the works, but Allan really isn't interested (and he'd like a bit more control over his vodka consumption). So he decides to escape.

She's charming and accommodating and prides herself on being loved by everyone. Everyone except sarcastic, cynical, and intimidating Joshua Templeman. Her nemesis.Josh is the dark and brooding to Lucy's light and cheery, the crisp pressed suit to her retro outfits and bright red lipstick. And he gets under her skin like no one else can. Trapped in a shared office together five days a week, they've become entrenched in an addictive, never-ending game of one-upmanship.When a new executive position is announced, Josh and Lucy are top contenders for the promotion, but the idea of working for the other is so unthinkable that they strike a deal: whoever doesn't get the job will walk away. The stakes have never been higher and as the competition heats up and the barriers between them begin to fall down, Lucy starts questioning just who her opponent truly is and whether this man she's hated all this time is even the real Josh.Maybe Lucy Hutton doesn't hate Joshua Templeman.

The Times 'Vivid reporting and electric story-telling.' Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk 'Clear-eyed and objective.' New York Times The extraordinary inside story of how Instagram became the world's most successful app In just ten years, Instagram has gone from being a simple photo app to a $100-billion company. The journey has involved ground-breaking innovations, a billion-dollar takeover, and clashes between some of the biggest names in tech. But it's a story that has never been told - until now. In No Filter, Bloomberg's Sarah Frier reveals how Instagram became the hottest app in a generation, reshaping our culture and economy in the process. With astonishing access to all the key players - from Instagram's co-founders to super-influencers like Kris Jenner - Frier offers behind-the-scenes glimpses of every moment in the company's life: from its launch, to its unlikely acquisition by Facebook, to its founders' dramatic disputes with their new boss, Mark Zuckerberg. But this is not just a Silicon Valley story. No Filter explores how Instagram has reshaped global business, creating a new economy of 'influencers' and pioneering a business model that sells an aspirational lifestyle to all of us. And it delves into Instagram's effects on popular culture, rewiring our understanding of celebrity and placing mounting pressure on all of us to perform online - to the point of warping our perception of reality. The resulting book connects one company's rise to a global revolution in technology, culture and business. Facebook's decision to buy Instagram was the best investment it ever made. But we're still learning about what it has cost the rest of us. _____ One of the best books of the year according to: The Times Fortune Financial Times Inc Economist Newsweek.

Though until now it has remained mostly anonymous, its members invented the concept of hacktivism, released the top tool for testing password security, and created what was for years the best technique for controlling computers from afar, forcing giant companies to work harder to protect customers. They contributed to the development of Tor, the most important privacy tool on the net, and helped build cyberweapons that advanced US security without injuring anyone. With its origins in the earliest days of the Internet, the cDc is full of oddball characters -- activists, artists, even future politicians. Many of these hackers have become top executives and advisors walking the corridors of power in Washington and Silicon Valley. The most famous is former Texas Congressman and current presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, whose time in the cDc set him up to found a tech business, launch an alternative publication in El Paso, and make long-shot bets on unconventional campaigns.Today, the group and its followers are battling electoral misinformation, making personal data safer, and battling to keep technology a force for good instead of for surveillance and oppression.

His job no longer existed. \"I think they just want to hire younger people,\" his boss at Newsweek told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the vague role of \"marketing fellow.\" What could go wrong? HubSpotters were true believers: They were making the world a better place ... by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; \"shower pods\" became hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the \"content factory,\" Nerf gun fights raged. Groups went on \"walking meetings,\" and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about employees who had \"graduated\" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball \"chair.\"", "isbn": 9780316306096, "publisher": "Hachette Books", "thumbnail": "https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780316306096-us.jpg", "url": "https://www.abebooks.com/9780316306096/Disrupted-Lyons-Dan-0316306096/plp"}, {"title": "Tarjeta Roja (Spanish Edition) - Softcover", "subtitle": null, "authors": ["Bensinger", "Ken"], "description": "\u00abUn libro oportuno y fascinante, una gira mundial a galope de la inmundicia y la corrupci\u00f3n que vadesde la Torre Trump hasta el coraz\u00f3n de Rusia.
