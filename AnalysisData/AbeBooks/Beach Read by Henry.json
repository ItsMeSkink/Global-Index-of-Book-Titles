He had not intended to stay longer, but, as he later wrote, \"I lingered on, and as the year lengthened into autumn, the beauty and mystery of this earth and outer sea so possessed and held me that I could not go.\" Beston stayed for a year, meditating on humanity and the natural world. In The Outermost House, originally published in 1928, he poetically chronicled the four seasons at the beach; the ebb and flow of the tides, the migration of birds, storms, stars, and solitude. The landscape was his major character, and his writing provides a snapshot of the Cape, a place physically changed yet as soulful 80 years later. Like Henry D. Thoreau before him, and Rachel Carson after him, Beston was a writer of stunning beauty, importance and vision. Robert Finch once wrote of him, His are burnished, polished sentences, richly metaphoric and musical, that beg to be read aloud. The Outermost House is a classic of American nature literature. It is now available, for the first time, on audio. *Including an interview with Beston biographer, Dr. Daniel G. Payne *Unabridged on 5 CDs / approximately 5 hours *Narrated by Brett Barry",

Beston/ The Fo'castle' on the front panel of the dust jacket and the front free endpaper; he apparently then gave it away, inscribing the front free endpaper, 'Signed for Joseph La Croix Esq. by his old friend the author. Henry Beston.' Tipped inside the front cover is a Beston ink manuscript four line poem, 'To a Dartymoor Low.' On the verso, in his hand 'Original Verse [with a drawing of three seagulls in ink, and a pencil date of 1928 in an unidentified hand, but probably the author's].' Very good in a good dust jacket with splits, wear, chips and interior tape reinforcement. A classic account of life by the sea, a year spent at what is now the National Seashore, the establishment of which was at least partially inspired by this book. New England has a fine literary tradition of its writers connecting with the landscape. Thoreau and Beston were fortunate in having nature closer at hand than those attempting today to follow that tradition; there are a lot of motels and miniature golf courses to pass by before the beauty of the Cape reveals itself.

William's parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died from tuberculosis, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to dime novels; his favorite works were Lane's translation of One Thousand and One Nights, and Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. Porter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter's elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was fifteen. In 1879, he started working in his uncle's drugstore and in 1881, at the age of nineteen, he was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed off his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.",

William's parents had married on April 20, 1858. When William was three, his mother died from tuberculosis, and he and his father moved into the home of his paternal grandmother. As a child, Porter was always reading, everything from classics to dime novels; his favorite works were Lane's translation of One Thousand and One Nights, and Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. Porter graduated from his aunt Evelina Maria Porter's elementary school in 1876. He then enrolled at the Lindsey Street High School. His aunt continued to tutor him until he was fifteen. In 1879, he started working in his uncle's drugstore and in 1881, at the age of nineteen, he was licensed as a pharmacist. At the drugstore, he also showed off his natural artistic talents by sketching the townsfolk.",

Helene grew up at Sugar Beach, a twenty-two-room mansion by the sea. Her childhood was filled with servants, flashy cars, a villa in Spain, and a farmhouse up-country. It was also an African childhood, filled with knock foot games and hot pepper soup, heartmen and neegee.

Jack Mullen is in law school in New York City when the shocking news comes that his brother Peter has drowned in the ocean off East Hampton.

    "description": "First edition, first issue with all points called for by Rothschild. Six volumes all bound in contemporary speckled brown calf, with raised bands, title labels, gilt rules and volume numbers to the spines. Page edges speckled red. A near fine set, sometime neatly rebacked to style. The contents generally clean and fresh, with a small chip to the lower margin of leaves M2 and R3 in volume three, affecting the text in neither case though grazing the initial in the former. Repaired closed tears to the title pages of volumes two and four. The author's masterpiece, which along with 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Gulliver', form the three great novels of the eighteenth century. It was Fielding's novel however, which established the genre as we know it today. Fielding was the first major novelist to unabashedly write fiction, at the same time undertaking an initial critical theory of the new form he was creating. The introductory chapters preceding the individual books in Tom Jones constitute the first extended body of work in English which attempts to define and explain the novel as a literary genre. A \"heroical, historical prosaic poem\" (IV, 1) or a form of \"prosai-comi-epic writing\" (V, 1). In defining the novel as an epic genre, Fielding emphasized its function in presenting a broad picture of an era, but one, unlike verse epic, in which the weaknesses of humanity are put on display. Although he termed his new style of writing \"history,\" his definition of the budding genre still influences our understanding of novelistic fiction. Such was the demand for this novel that the 2000 copies of the first edition and a proportion of the 1500 copy second edition all sold out before publication.

I detached, hinge of vol. vi invisibly reinforced, various bookplates and inscriptions of the Farquhars of Gilmilnescroft (Ayrshire), sound. Fielding's masterpiece, widely regarded as the greatest English novel of the eighteenth century. The question of cancelled leaves in this novel has exercised bibliographers for decades, but Hugh Amory's article in Harvard Library Bulletin (Volume 25, 1977) confirms that the cancellans usually number twenty-four (twelve single leaves plus the whole of signature O in volume three). The numerous errors which occurred in the text are a result of its hasty printing; demand for the novel forced publisher and author into print before they were properly ready. The fact that volume six, which contains some of the most glaring errors, is not included in the errata suggests that not only was Millar unable to bind fast enough to keep up with demand, but also that he did not wait for either proof readers or Fielding to read the last volume. The entire first edition of 2,000 copies was immediately bought up by the London trade, necessitating a second edition very quickly. Both Cross and Jensen support the view that the second edition was in hand at about the same time as the sixth volume of the first edition went to press. The latter goes further and suggests that the second edition may even have been printed before publication of the first. The most obvious difference is that the errata leaf in volume one is omitted and the re-spaced Contents extends into the page which it formerly occupied. Cross concludes that 'Tom Jones, as the novel [first] appeared in February, is a most rare book.' (Cross Vol.2, pp.117-22 and Vol.3, pp. 316-17: Jensen.

Notably, Tom's sexual promiscuity and strident behavior caused scandal among the novel's readers, but, nonetheless, Tom Jones quickly became an acclaimed novel, largely due to the effectiveness with which Fielding captured mid-18th century English society.

He himself believed he was 'the founder of a new province of writing'.

The novel presents many aspects of life at the time, set during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and the style of the narration is most personable. Henry Fielding (1707-1754) was an English writer and dramatist, remembered for founding the first intermittently funded and full-time police force; his writing was generally satirical and comedic by nature.

It was first published on 28 February 1749 in London and is among the earliest English works to be classified as a novel. It is the earliest novel mentioned by W. Somerset Maugham in his 1948 book Great Novelists and Their Novels among the ten best novels of the world. The novel is highly organised despite its length. Samuel Taylor Coleridge argued that it has one of the \"three most perfect plots ever planned\", alongside Oedipus Tyrannus and The Alchemist . It became a best seller with four editions published in its first year alone. It is generally regarded as Fielding's greatest book and as an influential English novel. This set is finely bound, but the binder apparently made an error in which volume 3 should match bindings with vols. 1 and 2. As you can see from the photo, all four volumes have the same attractive full leather bindings with rebacked spines. Vols. 1 and 2 are both of the \"New Edition of 1792. The volume labeled Vol. 3 however, is of an earlier 1773 edition that was published in four, not three volumes. The correct volume 3 for the 1792 edition is the volume with no volume number on the spine. Confused yet? However, but including all four volumes together, you will get the full three volume 1792 edition, but with Vol.3 having a variant binding, and an extra vol. 3 from the 1773 edition, but with a spine matching volumes 1 and 2. It's an interesting bookbinding anomaly. However, the set will be gorgeous on your shelf and a conversation starter with friends. (I would have liked to have been a fly on the wall during the discussion between the bookbinder and their client.) All volumes are full leather with gilt titles and ruling on spines. All have had the spines replaced and bindings strengthened with cloth on inside hinges. Very slight shelf wear overall, though there is a small scuffing at the top front corner of Vol. 2.

Includes: History of Tom Jones; Amelia; Adventures of Joseph Andrews; Life of Late Mr. Jonathan Wild; and Miscellaneous Writings. Henry Fielding ( Sharpham, 22 April 1707 - near Lisbon, 8 October 1754) was an English novelist and dramatist known for his rich earthy humour and satirical prowess, and as the author of the novel Tom Jones. Aside from his literary achievements, he has a significant place in the history of law-enforcement, having founded (with his half-brother John) what some have called London' s first police force, the Bow Street Runners, using his authority as a magistrate. Fielding never stopped writing political satire and satires of current arts and letters. Fielding took to writing novels in 1741 and his first major success was Shamela, an anonymous parody of Richardson's melodramatic novel. It is a satire that follows the model of the famous Tory satirists of the previous generation (Jonathan Swift and John Gay, in particular). He followed this up with Joseph Andrews (1742), an original work supposedly dealing with Pamela's brother, Joseph.[3] Although begun as a parody, this work developed into an accomplished novel in its own right and is considered to mark Fielding's debut as a serious novelist.

Six volumes all bound in contemporary speckled brown calf, with raised bands, title labels, gilt rules and volume numbers to the spines. Page edges speckled red. A near fine set, sometime neatly rebacked to style. The contents generally clean and fresh, with a small chip to the lower margin of leaves M2 and R3 in volume three, affecting the text in neither case though grazing the initial in the former. Repaired closed tears to the title pages of volumes two and four. The author's masterpiece, which along with 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Gulliver', form the three great novels of the eighteenth century. It was Fielding's novel however, which established the genre as we know it today. Fielding was the first major novelist to unabashedly write fiction, at the same time undertaking an initial critical theory of the new form he was creating. The introductory chapters preceding the individual books in Tom Jones constitute the first extended body of work in English which attempts to define and explain the novel as a literary genre. A \"heroical, historical prosaic poem\" (IV, 1) or a form of \"prosai-comi-epic writing\" (V, 1). In defining the novel as an epic genre, Fielding emphasized its function in presenting a broad picture of an era, but one, unlike verse epic, in which the weaknesses of humanity are put on display. Although he termed his new style of writing \"history,\" his definition of the budding genre still influences our understanding of novelistic fiction. Such was the demand for this novel that the 2000 copies of the first edition and a proportion of the 1500 copy second edition all sold out before publication.

    "description": "[heavy foxing to top edge, somewhat less on fore-edge, some soiling to book's covers, boards slightly warped, light musty smell; the jacket, however, has been affected by none of this, and is nearly flawless, with just a touch of soiling to the rear panel]. One of the more outrageous romans-a-clef in the annals of Hollywood fiction, a thinly fictionalized telling of the rise of MCA founder Jules Stein -- here \"Dr. Irwin Cone\" (nee 'Isidore Cohen\"), who builds his \"Talent Corporation of America\" into a powerful media giant, and who eventually moves to protect his empire from charges of monopoly by his behind-the-scenes manipulation of an appealing has-been cowboy star into the governorship of (as they say) \"a great Western state.\" This \"novel of greed, lust, ambition, and the cynical perversion of power\" depicts the ways in which Cone's Machiavellian ingenuity and cunning turn the actor, \"Jeff Jefferson\" (you fill in the real name here), into a full-blown political figure. One can only wonder if the author had an inkling in 1972 of what still lay ahead for Ronald Reagan, the real-life counterpart of Jeff Jefferson. (It's been rumored that there was an attempt at suppression of this novel -- certainly no one was likely to make it into a movie!) My favorite line of dialogue comes near the end, as one character speculates about the potential of the new Governor Jefferson, \"Sometimes the man takes over the office. Sometimes the office takes over the man. I guess with him it'll depend on whether he' s playing a governor or being one.\".  Seller Inventory # 22922\n        Contact seller",

Six volumes all bound in contemporary speckled brown calf, with raised bands, title labels, gilt rules and volume numbers to the spines. Page edges speckled red. A near fine set, sometime neatly rebacked to style. The contents generally clean and fresh, with a small chip to the lower margin of leaves M2 and R3 in volume three, affecting the text in neither case though grazing the initial in the former. Repaired closed tears to the title pages of volumes two and four. The author's masterpiece, which along with 'Robinson Crusoe' and 'Gulliver', form the three great novels of the eighteenth century. It was Fielding's novel however, which established the genre as we know it today. Fielding was the first major novelist to unabashedly write fiction, at the same time undertaking an initial critical theory of the new form he was creating. The introductory chapters preceding the individual books in Tom Jones constitute the first extended body of work in English which attempts to define and explain the novel as a literary genre. A \"heroical, historical prosaic poem\" (IV, 1) or a form of \"prosai-comi-epic writing\" (V, 1). In defining the novel as an epic genre, Fielding emphasized its function in presenting a broad picture of an era, but one, unlike verse epic, in which the weaknesses of humanity are put on display. Although he termed his new style of writing \"history,\" his definition of the budding genre still influences our understanding of novelistic fiction. Such was the demand for this novel that the 2000 copies of the first edition and a proportion of the 1500 copy second edition all sold out before publication.

I detached, hinge of vol. vi invisibly reinforced, various bookplates and inscriptions of the Farquhars of Gilmilnescroft (Ayrshire), sound. Fielding's masterpiece, widely regarded as the greatest English novel of the eighteenth century. The question of cancelled leaves in this novel has exercised bibliographers for decades, but Hugh Amory's article in Harvard Library Bulletin (Volume 25, 1977) confirms that the cancellans usually number twenty-four (twelve single leaves plus the whole of signature O in volume three). The numerous errors which occurred in the text are a result of its hasty printing; demand for the novel forced publisher and author into print before they were properly ready. The fact that volume six, which contains some of the most glaring errors, is not included in the errata suggests that not only was Millar unable to bind fast enough to keep up with demand, but also that he did not wait for either proof readers or Fielding to read the last volume. The entire first edition of 2,000 copies was immediately bought up by the London trade, necessitating a second edition very quickly. Both Cross and Jensen support the view that the second edition was in hand at about the same time as the sixth volume of the first edition went to press. The latter goes further and suggests that the second edition may even have been printed before publication of the first. The most obvious difference is that the errata leaf in volume one is omitted and the re-spaced Contents extends into the page which it formerly occupied. Cross concludes that 'Tom Jones, as the novel [first] appeared in February, is a most rare book.' (Cross Vol.2, pp.117-22 and Vol.3, pp. 316-17: Jensen.

Octavo, original publisher's decorated cloth with gilt titles to the spine. In near fine condition. An exceptional example, uncommon in this condition. George's first book, Progress and Poverty attempts to answer the questions of why poverty accompanies economic and technological progress and why economies exhibit a tendency toward cyclical boom and bust. Upon publication in 1880, the book helped spark the Progressive Era and a worldwide social reform movement around an ideology now known as 'Georgism'. Jacob Riis, for example, explicitly marks the beginning of the Progressive Era awakening as 1879 because of the date of this publication. rogress and Poverty had perhaps even a larger impact around the world, in places such as Denmark, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, where George's influence was enormous. Contemporary sources and historians claim that in the United Kingdom, a vast majority of both socialist and classical liberal activists could trace their ideological development to Henry George.

    "description": "San Francisco, Wm M.Hinton &amp; Co, 1879. 8vo. In the original full cloth binding with gilt lettering to spine and a bit of blindstamping to boeards. A bit of light spiotting to front board, spine faded, and capitals worn. Hinges internally a bit weak, and a professional closed tear to cloth at spine, barely noticeable. All in all an excellent copy in this fragile original binding. Internally very nice and clean. With the bookplate of Grove L. Johnson to inside of front board. (4), 512 pp. The exceedingly scarce first edition, printed in merely 200 copies (namely the \"Author's edition), of one of the most influential books ever published. Henry George's masterpiece of social reform, \"Progress and Poverty\", founded the ideology known as \"Georgism\", from which the worldwide social reform movement arose. The work initiated the Progressive Era and had a larger impact and \"a wider distribution than almost all other books on political economy put together\", as John Dewey put it (John Dewey's Foreword to Geiger's \"The Philosophy of Henry George\" (1933)). \"The present century has been marked by a prodigious increase in wealth-producing power. The utilization of steam and electricity, the introduction of improved processes and labor-saving machinery, the greater subdivision and grander scale of production, the wonderful facilitation of exchanges, have multiplied enormously the effectiveness of labor.At the beginning of this marvelous era it was natural to expect, and it was expected, that labor-saving inventions would lighten the toil and improve the condition of the laborer\" that the enormous increase in the power of producing wealth would make real poverty a thing of the past\", is how Henry George introduces his grandiose work of social reform. But though people naturally expected labor-saving inventions to improve working- and living conditions for all, quite the opposite was the case. As towns and cities grew - and grow - and new technologies continually improve methods of production and exchange, so misery, poverty and crime continued - and continues - to increase. Henry George magnificently pointed out the association of progress with poverty and how that precisely came to be the cause of our social and political difficulties. He pointed out, how this problem, if unsolved, would mean the downfall of civilization. And he provided the remedy - \"Deduction and induction have brought us to the same truth: Unequal ownership of land causes unequal distribution of wealth. And because unequal ownership of land is inseparable from the recognition of individual property in land, it necessarily follows that there is only one remedy for the unjust distribution of wealth: we must make land common property.\" More precisely, Henry George proposed a single tax on land values.Henry George's revolutionary first book, \"Progress and Poverty\" sold millions of copies and became a world-wide bestseller. In sales, it exceeded all other books except the Bible during the 1890s. The first edition, however, was only printed in 200 copies, designated \"Author's Edition\" and is very scarce - not least in the original binding.\"During the 1890s George, author of the 1879 bestseller Progress and Poverty, was the third most famous American, after Mark Twain and Thomas Edison. In 1896 he outpolled Teddy Roosevelt and was nearly elected mayor of New York.\"When Progress and Poverty first came out in 1879, it started a worldwide reform movement that in the US manifested in the fiercely anti-corporate Populist Movement in the 1880s and later the Progressive Movement (1900-1920). Many important anti-corporate reforms came out of this period, including the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890), a constitutional amendment allowing Americans to elect the Senate by popular vote (prior to 1913 the Senate was appointed by state legislators), and the country's first state-owned bank, The Bank of North Dakota (1919).\" (Stuart Jeanne Bramhall: Karl Marx vs Henry George, 2013).And the work co.

A presentation copy, inscribed: \"To Phil Habib, who made many Secretaries of State look good. with the admiration and affection of his friend Henry A. Kissinger,\" on the half-title page; laid-in are Kissinger's business card and 3 pages of notes, probably written by Margaret Adams, the senior editor of Wadsworth Publishing, detailing relations between Habib and Kissinger, probably for a future interview with the latter. ----- The \"New York Times\" once judged U. S. Ambassador Philip Habib, \"the outstanding professional diplomat of his generation.\" Like Secretary of State Kissinger, Habib was heavily involved in Middle East diplomacy, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1982. Upon his death, Kissinger said Habib was \"every Secretary of State's idea of a great foreign service officer.\" Kissinger eulogized Habib with the statement, \"He was one of my heroes. The great thing about him was that he was a terrific soldier.\" As evidenced by the numerous references to Habib in his memoirs, Kissinger relied a great deal on Habib's acumen and irreverence while serving as secretary of state. \"I might not do what he said,\" asserted Kissinger, \"But I wouldn't make a move without finding out what he thought.\" A handsome set with an exceptional provenance.

An amusing letter from the highly popular and controversial minister, novelist and reformer, to his good friend - or, as recent scholarship would have it, his very intimate friend - Chloe Beach, wife of Moses Beach, owner of the NEW YORK SUN. Beecher writes in such a fashion as to imply clearly that he is soliciting a dinner invitation: \"My Dear Mrs. Beach - Our larder is given out: - our tea used up - milk gone, bread scanty, sweetmeats passed away, and all of us are facing the probability of starvation tonight. Do you know of any place where we could get a loan of cold victuals? - or borrow some crackers, or even get a chance to come and eat a little? I would not trouble you but, you have the reputation of being charitable; and really, we are reduced to that condition of suffering that if you do not take us in, - why - we will go somewhere else. I am your friend bowed down with trouble. H.W. Beecher . P.S. We are willing to pay.\" It was through the Beach family, in 1867, that Beecher first connected with his ardent supporter, Samuel Clemens, and a case has been put forward (see Applegate, THE MOST FAMOUS MAN IN AMERICA: THE BIOGRAPHY OF HENRY WARD BEECHER, pp. 371-2) that in January of the same year Chloe Beach gave birth to a daughter by Henry W. Beecher. Accompanied by a carte de visite of Beecher, captioned in ink and pencil on recto and verso, and trimmed at the top corners.

Vertical and horizontal creases to actual letter, light toning of mounting leaf, small divots on left side of mounting leaf from removal from a bound volume, else Near Fine. Nicely preserved early example of a handwritten and signed letter by the perhaps preeminent Protestant minister in American history (and an early social liberal), written in Brooklyn, NY, where he was by then giving sermons to crowds of more than 2,500 from his pulpit in the Plymouth Church (Congregational). The letter is a written as vouching for a student who had spent the evening at Beecher's home, and thus deserved a \"credit mark\". Born in Litchfield, Connecticut in 1813, Beecher was schooled in Amherst (Mt. Pleasant Classical Insitution)and eventually ordained by the New School Presbytery of Cincinnati. His ultimate international repute as an orator, lecturer, and advocate of such causes as the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, evolutionary theory and scientific biblical criticism began to grow after he developed, in an Indianapolis pastorate prior to his famed Plymouth Church tenure, his notion that a sermon should focus on a single moral point for the purpose of specific moral development of the listener - a sermonal technique which still thrives. Among his more famous written works were: Seven Lectures to Young Men (1844); Evolution and Religion (1885); Life of Jesus the Christ (1871-91); Yale Lectures on Preaching (1872-74); and a novel, Norwood: A Tale of Village Life in New England.

It was co-founded by businessman, abolitionist, and president of the 1850 Boston Vigilance Committee Timothy Gilbert (1797 - 1865), who had been expelled from the New England Church in 1836 for inviting several African-Americans to join him in his pew. The church would be renamed Tremont Temple in 1843 and would become the first one in Boston to abolish pew rental fees. It would also become known as the \"first integrated church in America,\" stating that \"all who practice slavery or justify it shall be excluded from the church and its communion.\" It would quickly become tied to Boston's Underground Railroad and to the Suffrage Movement. It would also serve as a venue for public events and speeches, including Charles Dickens' first reading during his 1867 1868 tour of the United States. The current program, listing the order of exercises and printing several poems and songs in their entirety, was published in connection with the memorial services held at the temple and honoring Ulysses S. Grant. The event was organized by author, lecturer, abolitionist, and suffragist Julia Ward Howe (1819 - 1910), whose \"Ode\" was featured in the program; Unitarian minister, author, and ardent advocate of Darwinian Evolutionistic Optimism Minot Judson Savage (1841 - 1918); social reformer, abolitionist, brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and author Henry Ward Beecher (1813 - 1887); and others.

He was a religious guide to multiple Republican presidents, including Abraham Lincoln, who said that no one in history had \"so productive a mind.\" A recent work on his life by Debby Applegate, titled \"The Most Famous Man in America: The Biography of Henry Ward Beecher,\" won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 2007.

Evelyn Fowler Grubb was an American heroine and an eyewitness to the history recorded in this book. She was the wife of U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Wilmer Newlin Grubb who was shot down over North Vietnam in 1966 and photographed alive and well at his capture. Throughout the course of the war, Evelyn and thousands of other wives and family members were unable to get information or contact their loved ones. The U.S. government was unable to get reliable information and was hesitant to release unconfirmed data. The North Vietnamese government refused to provide information, and completely ignored the Geneva Conventions. This book traces the heart-rending journey of these families through the life of Evelyn Grubb and her family.  You Are Not Forgotten is also the story of the founding of the National League of Families and its role in the history of the period. Without any experience in the development of organizations, Evelyn became one of the founding members of the National League of Families of POW/MIA. In 1971, she became its National Coordinator in Washington, D.C., and served on its Board of Directors until 1974. From 1966 to 1974 she transformed herself from wife and mother to a national and international advocate for the American POWs and MIAs. In that capacity, together with hundreds of other POW/MIA family members, she lobbied relentlessly for enforcement of the Geneva Conventions, the humane treatment of POWs, and an accounting of our MIAs. While raising her four sons alone, she interacted with government officials at the highest levels in the United States-- including Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon--and in many other countries. After eight long and traumatic years of waiting and hoping, Evelyn and her family were officially notified that her beloved Newk had perished in captivity from unsubstantiated causes soon after his capture. You Are Not Forgotten is a significant history of the period. Just as importantly, however, it is the powerful, personal, and emotional journey of a group of strong and capable women and men who came together, grew in stature and cohesiveness to ensure that their husbands and loved ones would not be forgotten.",

The two major foreign policy crises in this book, one successfully negotiated, one that ended tragically, were unique in that they moved so fast that much of the work on them had to be handled by telephone. The longer of the two sections deals in detail with the Yom Kippur War and is full of revelations, as well as great relevancy: In Kissinger's conversations with Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister; Simcha Dinitz, Israeli ambassador to the U.S.; Mohamed el-Zayyat, the Egyptian Foreign Minister; Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary General of the U.N.; and a host of others, as well as with President Nixon, many of the main elements of the current problems in the Middle East can be seen. The section on the end of the Vietnam War is a tragic drama, as Kissinger tries to help his president and a divided nation through the final moments of a lost war. It is full of astonishing material, such as Kissinger's trying to secure the evacuation of a Marine company which, at the very last minute, is discovered to still be in Saigon as the city is about to fall, and his exchanges with Ambassador Martin in Saigon, who is reluctant to leave his embassy. This is a book that presents perhaps the best record of the inner workings of diplomacy at the superheated pace and tension of real crisis.",

    "description": "By drawing upon hitherto unpublished transcripts of his telephone conversations during the Yom Kippur War (1973) and the last days of the Vietnam War (1975), Henry Kissinger reveals what goes on behind the scenes at the highest levels in a diplomatic crisis. The two major foreign policy crises in this book, one successfully negotiated, one that ended tragically, were unique in that they moved so fast that much of the work on them had to be handled by telephone. The longer of the two sections deals in detail with the Yom Kippur War and is full of revelations, as well as great relevancy: In Kissinger's conversations with Golda Meir, Israeli Prime Minister; Simcha Dinitz, Israeli ambassador to the U.S.; Mohamed el-Zayyat, the Egyptian Foreign Minister; Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; Kurt Waldheim, the Secretary General of the U.N.; and a host of others, as well as with President Nixon, many of the main elements of the current problems in the Middle East can be seen. The section on the end of the Vietnam War is a tragic drama, as Kissinger tries to help his president and a divided nation through the final moments of a lost war. It is full of astonishing material, such as Kissinger's trying to secure the evacuation of a Marine company which, at the very last minute, is discovered to still be in Saigon as the city is about to fall, and his exchanges with Ambassador Martin in Saigon, who is reluctant to leave his embassy. This is a book that presents perhaps the best record of the inner workings of diplomacy at the superheated pace and tension of real crisis.",

About the author: Van Dyke was born on November 10, 1852, in Germantown, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Henry Jackson van Dyke Sr. (1822 1891), a prominent Brooklyn Presbyterian clergyman known in the antebellum years for his anti-abolitionist views. The family traced its roots to Jan Thomasse van Dijk, who emigrated from Holland to North America in 1652. (Wiki). Literary Legacy: Various religious themes of his work are expressed in his poetry, hymns and the essays collected in Little Rivers (1895) and Fisherman's Luck (1899). He wrote the lyrics to the popular hymn \"Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee\" (1907), sung to the tune of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\". He compiled several short stories in The Blue Flower (1902), named after the key symbol of Romanticism introduced first by Novalis. One of van Dyke's best-known poems is titled \"Time Is\" (Music and Other Poems, 1904), also known as \"For Katrina's Sundial\" because it was composed to be an inscription on a sundial in the garden of an estate owned by his friends Spencer and Katrina Trask. The second section of the poem, which was read at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, reads as follows: Time is Too slow for those who Wait, Too swift for those who Fear, Too long for those who Grieve, Too short for those who Rejoice, But for those who Love, Time is not. (This is the original poem; some versions have \"Eternity\" in place of \"not.\") The poem inspired the song \"Time Is\" by the group It's a Beautiful Day on their eponymous 1969 debut album. Another interpretation of the poem is a song entitled \"Time\" by Mark Masri (2009). In 2003, the same section of the poem was chosen for a memorial in Grosvenor Square, London, dedicated to British victims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The poem is also used as the closing of the 2013 novel Child of Time, by Bob Johnson. CONDITION NOTES: Very good; light wear not commensurate with age and use (e.g. (1) spine cover moderately sunned, sporadic wear at extremities, light age-toned text/illustration pages, lightly rubbed glassine wraps), strong square spines/tight bindings.

Hopper's wife came on the scene to observe: 'Scribner's were wonderful to him, let him go his own gait, careful not to give him things not his kind to do.' His kind: te first story they gave him to read was 'The hearing ear', by Henry Van Dyke, which dealt with heroic rescue in the war. The two drawings, which appeared in the issue of December 1918, added one hundred dollars to Edward's books.\" ; Dark blue (C183)--calico grain cloth; gilt lettering framed by gold, with red and white lily designs; flower motif repeated on spine in gilt; partially untrimmed ; Trade edition issued in dark blue cloth ; foxing ; name on front endpaper ; scarce Hopper source ; VG.

    "description": "Octavo, pp. [1-6] [1-3] 4-243 [244-250] [note: first two and last three leaves are blanks], original blue cloth, front and spine panels stamped in gold. First edition. Limited to 100 copies numbered and signed by Van Dyke, plus some out-of-series copies, this being one of the latter. Eccentric occult science fiction novel, sequel to THE FLASH, also privately printed by the author in an edition of 100 copies in Miami, Arizona, in 1927. THE FLASH and its sequel first appeared as serials in the Miami, Arizona, DAILY SILVER BELT. This is definitely not your usual Victorian, talking-heads-in-flowing-white-robes kind of occult romance; but rather a wild and wooly tale in the American tradition of such works as RONDAH, REVI-LONA, and DR. ZELL AND THE PRINCESS CHARLOTTE. It's a red-blooded, action-packed adventure, blending backdrops of the Wild West and the Roaring Twenties, complete with bootleggers, prize fighters, romantic passion, grizzled prospectors, super science and a bizarre 25-page journey through an underworld cavern in which we learn about Glowhumes, unsaturated Electrohumes, the Ancient Order of Wasted Propaganda, radicals and coefficients, the Interrogator and the Disseminator, and the progressive concentration of \"sparkles\" as one ascends the food chain. Taken together, they form the wacky, sui generis occultism that animates this story philosophically. Here is a quest whose hunted treasure turns out to be multilayered both figuratively and literally. It follows the adventures of Charlie, Mary and Frank (brother, sister, friend) in search of unspecified treasure at the foot of Sleeping Beauty, seen in a vision in Chicago, drawing them across the country in a covered wagon until they arrive in Arizona at a mountainous formation that looks like a giant Sleeping Beauty. Charlie is given to trances and astral travel, and early on in the story fails to return from one. It is his corpse, strapped to a rubber air mattress gliding sideways across a raging river that initiates the trip to the underworld. Mary is beautiful, quick, ethereal and extremely devoted to Charlie. Frank is brawny, slow, down-to-earth and extremely devoted to Mary. The story in large part is about how Mary becomes more earthy (and humble) and Frank more spiritual (and confident) until they pass through all the inner and outer obstacles keeping them apart as a romantic couple. Along the way, Frank becomes a champion prize fighter under the management of Dorothy, a feisty and fetching schoolteacher who gets off a bus to help Frank after the storm that separates him from Mary, but who then gets a taste of the fast life on Frank's winnings and finds another lover. Mary becomes a celebrated mind-reader, fortuneteller and faith-healer under the cynical management of her Uncle Joseph, a cagey prospector fond of doing vocal impressions. Van Dyke lacks the polish of the professional writer and is sometimes awkward, abrupt or confusing; but he tells a complex yet fast-moving story and tells it with suspense, psychological credibility, thematic depth, and comedy (sometimes unintentional). Most impressive is how he combines customarily opposite qualities, writing convincingly of the city and the desert, the boxing ring and a magical cavern, crooks and angels, thus making his book itself an intriguing example of blended worlds. A significant book that should be better known. Not in Bleiler (1948; 1978), Reginald (1979; 1992) or Day (1963). Locke, A Spectrum of Fantasy Volume II, p. 110.

    "description": "First edition. Publisher's dark blue cloth designed by Margaret Armstrong (unsigned); in the scarce original dust jacket, light green laid paper stamped in dark green, a simple design, not matching the binding. Very good or better book, text block uniformly toned and with some darker foxing to endpapers and prelims, small nick to rear free endpaper at top edge, some very light wear to corners, cloth bright and clean; in a very good unclipped dust jacket, with some toning to spine, light scattered foxing and soiling most notably to rear panel, shallow chipping to head of spine and two small holes near middle of spine. Overall, an attractive book in an excellent example of the extremely scarce dust jacket. Camp-Fires and Guide-Posts is a collection of essays and reflections by Henry Van Dyke, minister, diplomat, and professor of English at Princeton University. Specifically, it includes \"Fishing in Strange Waters,\" \"Japonica,\" \"Firelight Views,\" \"A Certain Insularity of Islanders,\" \"Sympathetic Antipathies,\" and \"Interludes on the Koto,\" among others. In addition to his essays, this volume also includes what Van Dyke calls interludes, which he says, \"may be taken as talks by the camp-fire,\" as well as several tributes to fellow beloved travelers. Notably, this volume is one of many bindings that are part of a uniform set of Van Dyke's novels, published from 1895-1926. Margaret Armstrong (1867-1944) was a renowned artist and designer. Along with her contemporary Sarah Wyman Whitman (1824-1904), Armstrong is an example of how the Arts and Crafts and Aesthetic movements at the time provided new opportunities for women's employment in the arts. After beginning her career with A. C. McClurg, Armstrong worked primarily for Scribner's and specifically focused on the works of a few authors. Armstrong's style, which was influenced by the floral patterns of Art Nouveau and the lines and shapes that are characteristic of the Arts and Crafts movement, made her bindings distinct, which was useful in terms of advertisement and branding an author's works as a unique set.

    "description": "FIRST EDITION OF A SEMINAL WORK OF AMERICAN LITERATURE WITH MANUSCRIPT LEAF FROM THOREAU'S MEMOIRS. First published in a run of two-thousand copies in Thoreau's native Massachusetts, Walden; Or, Life in the Woods (1854) synthesises the thematic core of the Transcendentalist movement: a simple life with immediate connection to the natural world. During the second quarter of the nineteenth century, Thoreau cloistered himself in a cabin built by himself within the acreage of Ralph Waldo Emerson's woodland in Concord, Massachusetts. From this isolated sojourn emerged Thoreau's most prolific work, which encapsulates his ideas on self-reliance and humankind's relationship with nature. \"If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer,\" writes Thoreau, continuing, \"Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\" (Walden, p. 348). At the turn of the century and following the author's death in 1862, Thoreau's collected works were published in twenty volumes by Houghton Mifflin. The project including a limited run of highly sought-after Manuscript Editions-which contained a leaf from Thoreau's manuscripts mounted and bound into the first volume of each set. The present copy is one such first volume, and its leaf constitutes an excerpt in Thoreau's hand from his posthumously-published 1866 memoir A Yankee in Canada. The work details his travels in Montreal and the present passage, from the chapter \"The Walls of Quebec\", describes his encounter with a Scots emigr\u00e9 in Quebec as they walk from a barrack along the famous walls of the city. A Yankee in Canada documented the only excursion Thoreau made outside of the United States, with this particular passage featuring a conversation with an individual he meets there, thus providing a thematic counterpoint to the hermitic life recorded in Walden-as attested by the timeless line \"I want the flower and fruit of a man\" (Walden, p. 83). Another insight offered by this unique holograph of A Yankee in Canada concerns how Thoreau modulates his celebrated style natural observation to a mode of recounting human interaction. \"Thus being naturally drawn together\", he pens while recalling how he meets the Scots-Canadian, whereas the authorised editions of the work read, \"being thus mutually drawn together\" (A Yankee in Canada, p. 75). The alteration is slight, and whether it is an authorial emendation or one from an editor is uncertain. But, of the two word, \"naturally\" better reflects Thoreau's sensibilities towards the certain id\u00e9es fixes which inspired much of his literary engagement with the Transcendental movement: environmentalism and natural history. Yet, with \"mutually\" Thoreau perhaps affords a closer, more sympathetic bond to the stranger in contrast to the relationships he forages with the environment, recognising in a fellow human motivations better described as mutual than natural.

    "description": "Philadelphia: John Sartain &amp; Co., 1852. Verne translation by Anne T. Wilbur. All eight numbers from volumes X and XI of Sartain's Union Magazine [January through June 1857 comprising Vol X., with July and August of 1852 - after which Sartain's ceased publication - comprising Vol. XI]. Vol. X 516 pp., Vol XI 208 pp., bound as one volume. 10\" x 6.75\" , half black morocco with marbled paper boards. Personalized plate at center cover, apparently as produced, in the name of Jane A. Warner. Later of the Forbes Library, Northampton, MA., with that organization's bookplate at front pastedown and perforated stamp at title page, other Forbes indication at rear endpapers. Binding is quite scuffed, with corners and spine ends thoroughly affected; hinges starting. Sporadic light foxing throughout, lightly showing a bit at the Verne first appearance in some margins only, not affecting the Thoreau first appearances. Good plus for the volume, Very Good plus or better for the textblock as a whole and the subject entries in particular. In the dying months of Sartain's Union Magazine in 1852, it might have been of some benefit had that publisher been able to look to the future and understand the significance of what was contained in the the May, July and August numbers: The first appearance in English of Jules Verne [\"A Voyage in a Balloon\"], in May, and the first appearance of any portion of Henry David Thoreau's Walden [two essays, \"The Iron Horse\" in July and \"A Poet Buying a Farm\" in August]. Therein the last Sartain's hardbound volume contained seminal appearances of what would become two of the the most significant and most widely reprinted authors in history, in two vastly disparate genres. Sartain's had, with its last gasps, done with these three short and - at the time - inconspicuous pieces exactly what so many periodical publications of its type and era sought to do. This volume contains all eight months; it appears that some, perhaps most, other examples of the hardbound volume did not include the July and August numbers containing Thoreau's essays, although statistics on this point are unavailable to me. \"A Voyage in a Balloon\" - as \"Un Voyage en Balloon\" - was Verne's second tale, published originally in France a year earlier. Anne T. Wilbur translated the 7-page story for Sartain's - and even received, in the index, authorship credit, although the story itself is rightly credited. Later to become part of the Doctor Ox aggregations, it was - Taves &amp; Michaluk, V012 - \"apparently the first time Verne ever appeared in English.\" He would have been about twenty-four years old at the time. The two Thoreau essays - respectively three pages and one page in Sartain's dense double-column presentation - were the first taste ever of Walden, which was published in book form two years later, in 1854. Bearing as well the seemingly countless articles, stories, poems and charming engravings which were the stock-in-trade of such publications, this one, particular, dying volume of Sartain's Magazine may be, much more significantly, a peerless confluence of inchoate genius, from two who would thereafter take distinct paths to literary immortality.

    "description": "First Edition, LATER PRINTING. Published by Ticknor and Fields anywhere between 1862 - 1881. * * * ABOUT: Based on our research, we believe this volume was published from the original and uncorrected first edition printing plates of Walden. A dive into the publishing history of Thoreau's Walden strongly indicates that this is a First Edition, Later Printing printed anywhere from 1862-1871. Our best estimate is that this is one of the later of these printings (closer to 1871). * Spelling and word errors as appeared in the 1st/1st: All are present. Subsequent editions of Walden were printed with corrected plates, but this copy retains the original mistakes indicating it was printed from the first edition plates. * As time wore on and subsequent printings made from the first edition plates, the printing plates began to wear down. A few repairs were made by the printer resulting in the darkening of parts of a few words. This book shows the darkened marks in keeping with this, strongly suggesting it is a later printing from the first edition plates (up to the 17th printing). * The brown cloth covered boards are uniform with the first edition, first printing (1st/1st). The 1st/1st showed Thoreau's original full title on the spine reading, \"Walden: or, Life in the Woods\". Near his death in 1862, Thoreau asked publishers Ticknor and Fields to change the title to simply \"Walden\", as on this volume. * * * CONDITION: The volume is missing the title/copyright page so there is no publication date. It is possible the book has been repaired or had further alterations made to it throughout its life. When the book was printed for the second time in 1862, the \"or, Life in the Woods\" was removed from it and subsequent printings. Front end paper: to our eyes, the front end paper appears a cream color. Rear End papers: light yellow with copious pencil markings Map: present. Facing page 307. Advertisements: None. If these were bound in the front of the book, it is possible they were also removed with the title page. * * * Other than the unfortunate missing title page, the book is in overall good condition. Binding is secure with some cracking and exposing of the hinges but not compromising structure. Fraying noted over the top and bottom of the spine. Gold gilt remains clear and readable. Staining noted on front cover (please see photos), and normal age-related wear, including some bumping to book corners. More photos available upon request. * * * FUNDRAISER: All profit from this book will be donated to Concord's Civil War Monument Gift Fund to help replace and update the monument's plaque to include and honor the name of George Washington Dugan. Dugan, a free African American man from Concord, was a member of Massachusetts' 54th Regiment under command of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. Along with Shaw and approximately 40% of his regiment, Dugan was killed at the Battle of Fort Wagner, South Carolina. His body was never recovered leading to his being listed as \"missing in action\". Now, thanks to the tireless research of historians Rick Frese and Beth van Duzer, Dugan's rightful place on Concord's Civil War Monument has been proven and an effort is underway to update the monument.

During the two years and two months he spent there, he began to write Walden, his most important work, a chronicle of his communion with nature that became one of the most influential and compelling books in American literature. Since its first publication on August 9, 1854, by Ticknor and Fields, the work has become a classic, beloved for its message of living simply and in harmony with nature.This special 150th anniversary edition of Walden features exquisite wood engravings by Michael McCurdy, one of America's leading engravers and woodblock artists. McCurdy's engravings bring the text to life\u2014and illuminate the spirit of Thoreau's prose. Also included is a foreword by noted author, environmentalist, and naturalist Terry Tempest Williams, who reflects upon Thoreau's message that as we explore our world and ourselves, we draw ever closer to the truth of our connectedness.",

JUST MENTION IMAGECODE IN THE REMARKS FIELD AT THE TIME OF PLACING ORDER. FROM THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF PEOPLE WE MEET ON VACATION AND BOOK LOVERS! A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters. Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast. They're polar opposites. In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's block. Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She'll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he'll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in love. Really. Language: English.  Seller Inventory # SD9781984806734IG\n        Contact seller",

Look no further. ______________________________ TWO WRITERS, ONE HOLIDAY. A ROMCOM WAITING TO HAPPEN. January is a hopeless romantic who narrates her life like she's the lead in a blockbuster movie. Gus is a serious literary type who thinks true love is a fairy-tale. But January and Gus have more in common than you'd think: They're both broke. They've got crippling writer's block.

In telling each other's stories, their worlds might be changed entirely.

JUST MENTION IMAGECODE IN THE REMARKS FIELD AT THE TIME OF PLACING ORDER. \"One of my favorite authors.\"--Colleen Hoover An insightful, delightful, instant #1 New York Times bestseller from the author of Beach Read and People We Meet on Vacation. Named a Most Anticipated Book of 2022 by Oprah Daily ? Today ? Parade ? Marie Claire ? Bustle ? PopSugar ? Katie Couric Media ? Book Bub ? SheReads ? Medium ? The Washington Post ? and more! One summer. Two rivals. A plot twist they didn't see coming. Nora Stephens' life is books--she's read them all--and she is not that type of heroine. Not the plucky one, not the laidback dream girl, and especially not the sweetheart. In fact, the only people Nora is a heroine for are her clients, for whom she lands enormous deals as a cutthroat literary agent, and her beloved little sister Libby. Which is why she agrees to go to Sunshine Falls, North Carolina for the month of August when Libby begs her for a sisters' trip away--with visions of a small town transformation for Nora, who she's convinced needs to become the heroine in her own story. But instead of picnics in meadows, or run-ins with a handsome country doctor or bulging-forearmed bartender, Nora keeps bumping into Charlie Lastra, a bookish brooding editor from back in the city. It would be a meet-cute if not for the fact that they've met many times and it's never been cute. If Nora knows she's not an ideal heroine, Charlie knows he's nobody's hero, but as they are thrown together again and again--in a series of coincidences no editor worth their salt would allow--what they discover might just unravel the carefully crafted stories they've written about themselves.

The present-buying, decorating and food shopping have all been left to her. So she wonders . . . what would happen if she ran away and left them to it? Lizzy heads to her favourite place: a beach hut on the golden sands of Everdene. There she meets an unlikely collection of new friends, all running away from something. But the spirit of Christmas gets under Lizzy's skin: soon the fairy lights are twinkling and the scent of mulled wine mingles with the sea air. Back at Pepperpot Cottage, her family are desperate to find her. For Christmas isn't Christmas without Lizzy. Can they track her down in time and convince her she means the world to them, every day of the year?

Allegra\u2019s fictional story is raw, unnerving, and sadly, very true.\u201d \u2014Jodi Picoult, New York Times bestselling author of Small Great Things and A Spark of Light \u201cA very stylish and entertaining debut.\u201d \u2014Jay McInerney, author of Bright Lights, Big City In this sizzling debut for fans of The Devil Wears Prada, Wall Street banking analyst Allegra Cobb plans to quit the minute her year-end bonus hits her account, finally pursuing her yoga career full-time. But when she forms an intense relationship with the #InstaFamous guru who may hold the ticket to the life Allegra's always wanted\u2014she's not sure if she'll be able to keep her sanity intact (and her chakras aligned) until bonus day. Allegra Cobb\u2019s resume: Straight-A Princeton grad, second-year analyst at a top-tier bank, one-time American Yoga National Competition Champion. Allegra Cobb\u2019s reality: Spends twenty-four hours a day changing the colors on bar charts, overusing the word \u201cteam,\u201d and daydreaming about quitting the minute her year-end bonus hits her account. She has no interest in the cutthroat banking world\u2014she\u2019s going to launch her very own yoga practice.  But her plan isn\u2019t quite as perfect as the beachfront yoga pictures she double-taps on Instagram. On top of the 100 emails an hour and coworkers already suspicious of her escape plan, Allegra's hard-driving single father has always expected fiercely high achievement above all else. That his daughter works on Wall Street means everything to him. Still, she marches on, taking it day by extremely caffeinated day.  But after (1) unknowingly sleeping with the man now leading her banking cohort on one of their biggest deals to date and (2) meeting the #blessed yoga guru who might just be her ticket to the life she\u2019s always wanted, it really hits her: her happy-ever-after will be harder to manifest than she thought.  Fast-paced, laugh-out-loud funny, and totally irresistible, this is the story of a fearless young woman determined to center herself in the life she truly wants.",

Presentation copy, inscribed by the author, \"N.G. Wright with the compliments of Henry Clews Nov. 11, 97.\" In near fine condition. A very sharp example. Perhaps the 19th century's best book on Wall Street, this work provides a fascinating look at the financial markets during a period of rapid economic expansion. Henry Clews was a giant figure in finance at that time, and his firsthand account brings this colorful era to life like never before. He reveals shocking stories of political and economic manipulation and how he helped bring down the mighty Boss Tweed. He writes eloquently about the madness of the markets and how the era's greatest speculators amassed their fortunes. This book provides an expansive view of Wall Street in an era of little regulation, rampant political corruption, and rapid financial change. Henry Clews was born in England in 1836 and emigrated to the United States in 1850. In 1859, he cofounded what became the second largest marketer of federal bonds during the Civil War. Later, he organized the \"Committee of 70,\" which deposed the corrupt Tweed Ring in New York City, and served as an economic consultant to President Ulysses Grant. \"Twenty-Eight Years In Wall Street book should be in the hands of every Wall Street man, young or old, and should be read by every student of the financial history of this country\" (The Daily Indicator, Contemporary Review).
