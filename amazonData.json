    "description": "Is money an important feature of your life? Do you know enough about it or do you find it something of a mystery? Would detailed information help you to link wealth with happiness for your long-term future? Money is an important part of almost every society. It provides us with the means to live, eat, have shelter, enjoy ourselves, take vacations, and many other things. Without money, life can be hard, but just because you have lots of it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re enjoying life. There is a fine line between need and greed and an even finer one between happiness and a life that is miserable.

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don\u2019t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In The Psychology of Money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life\u2019s most important matters.

We all have a unique relationship with money, this is determined by a host of attitudes, opinions and also past experiences. These and several other factors predispose us to living a life in a way where money works in a positive way to achieve our goals. On the surface, money is just a physical bill or a few coins....but the emotion humans attach to it make it most significant thing in our lives. Most of our emotional connection to money is grounded in our memories from childhood, and we are mostly not conscious or aware that our money history is playing a role in it. We all should actually take a journey down our own money history, and examine how that shaped our experiences related to money. We may discover and even identify variety of responses that we habitually have towards money, like hoarding, anxiety, guilt, fear that are probably a part of your money history.",

Few are good at it. From business to economics, politics to social trends, we\u2019re just not very good at predicting what happens next. According to Morgan Housel, this is because we focus too much on what we think will change and not enough on what we know will stay the same. If you traveled in time to 500 years ago or 500 years from now, you would be astounded at how much technology and medicine has changed. The geopolitical order would make no sense to you. The language and dialect may be completely foreign. But you\u2019d notice people falling for greed and fear just like they do in our current world. You\u2019d see people persuaded by risk, jealousy, and tribal affiliations in ways that are familiar to you. You\u2019d see overconfidence and short-sightedness that reminds you of people's behavior today. You\u2019d find people seeking the secret to a happy life and trying to find certainty when none exists in ways that are so relatable. When transported to an unfamiliar world, you\u2019d spend a few minutes watching people behave and say, \u201cAh. I\u2019ve seen this before. Same as ever.\u201d History is filled with surprises no one could have seen coming. But if we learn to see what doesn\u2019t change, we can be more confident in our choices, no matter what the future brings.",

Drawing on the latest research in psychology, neuroscience and behavioural economics, she draws an anatomy of the power it holds over us. She also reveals some simple and effective tricks that will help you use and save money better\u2014from how being grumpy can stop you getting ripped off to why you should opt for the more expensive pain relief and why you should never offer to pay your friends for favours.

In The Laws of Wealth , psychologist and behavioral finance expert Daniel Crosby presents three sets of real, actionable rules that investors can use to apply the lessons of behavioral finance. He begins with ten rules that are the hallmarks of good investor behavior, including 'Forecasting is for Weathermen,' 'If You're Excited, It's Probably a Bad Idea,' and \u2018Trouble is Opportunity.' From here, attention turns to the Four Cs of Rule-Based Investing: Consistency, Clarity, Courageousness, Conviction. The Four Cs provide practical methods to combat behavioral risk in investing. And finally, he introduces the Five Ps of successful equity investing: Price, Properties, Pitfalls, People, Push. Investors can draw on these five methods to select stocks and take advantage of behavioral opportunities in the stock market. Throughout, anecdotes, research, and graphics illustrate the lessons in memorable ways. And in highly valuable 'What now?' summaries at the end of each chapter, Crosby provides clear, concise direction on what to think, ask, and do next to become a better investor. If you are wondering what years of behavioral finance has delivered for real investors, you should follow the laws of wealth to manage your behavior and improve your investing!",

But why do we behave the way we do with it? And why does it have such a hold on us? Award-winning BBC Radio 4 presenter Claudia Hammond delves into the surprising psychology of money to show us that our relationship with the stuff is more complex than we might think. Exploring the latest research in psychology, neuroscience, biology and behavioural economics, she also reveals some simple and effective tricks that will help you think about, use and save money better - from how being grumpy helps if you don't want to be ripped off to why you should opt for the more expensive pain relief, from how to shop for a new laptop to why you should never offer to pay your friends for favours. An eye-opening and entertaining investigation into the power money holds over us, Mind Over Money will change the way you view the cash in your wallet and the figures in your bank account forever.",

If you traveled in time to 500 years in the past or to 500 years in the future, you would be astounded at how much technology and medicine have changed. The geopolitical order would make no sense. The language and dialect may be completely foreign.\u202fBut you\u2019d notice universal principles guiding behavior\u2014people falling for greed and fear, short-sighted by overconfidence, and persuaded by risk and jealousy, just like they do today. When transported to this unfamiliar world, you\u2019d spend a few minutes watching people behave and say, \u201cAh. I\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d In Same as Ever , Morgan Housel offers readers a world historical tour of the behaviors that have played a decisive role in history\u2019s big moments, from the invention of the first nuclear weapons to the founding of Amazon, from T.E. Lawrence to Jack Welch. These stories on risk, opportunity, and living a good life teach us the timeless lessons worth paying attention to so we can separate the signal from the noise and optimize our decision-making. History is filled with surprises no one could have seen coming. But if we learn to see what doesn\u2019t change, we can be more confident in our choices, no matter what the future brings.",
