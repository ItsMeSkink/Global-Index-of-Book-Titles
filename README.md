Draft - 1 is solely based on creating basic logic behind the GIBT program.
Further improvements is mentioned in  "Notes For the First Draft.jpg"
Some logic that give subpar results would be eliminated and new logics would be developed.

Draft 1 is successful in many cases, not all.

Some ISBNS - Titles that work with this:
9781473695986 - Brief Answers to the Big Questions 
9781422196021 - Innovator's Dillema
9789391165482 - Do Epic Shit
9780099590088 - Sapiens - A Brief History of Human Kind
9789380703688 - On the Origin of Species
9789332585348 - Python Programming A Modular Approach
9789389053029 - Moment of Signal
9780008386597 - Think like a Monk
9780141988511 - 12 Rules of Life
9781591842804 - Start with Why
9781544512273 - Can't Hurt Me
9789390166268 - Psychology of Money

Above are some programs which do work with this though return result is limited to the title for now and the time of return is really slow

Although there are some books like 978388369695 (The Art of War) and 9780553175219 (Brief History of Time) which logically should yield expected results according to manual googling

Draft-2 would be focussing on accurate data retrieval

It is a great journey and I hope the best for the future
