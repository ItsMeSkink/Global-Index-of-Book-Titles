I loved the examples that the author highlighted (like the Wright brothers, Southwest Airlines, Disney, and Costco) and thought they were a great fit. I also learned a lot from them (both from the history side and the book\u2019s message side). My only criticism is that I didn\u2019t always like the transitions between story examples. A lot of the time, the author would start talking about an example, finish part of the story, continue with something else, and then return to it later. And I get that; I understood why he was choosing to do so. I just don\u2019t think all of the transitions worked, and when they didn\u2019t, they would take me out of my enjoyment in reading the book. Is it a big deal? No, but enough of one to lower the rating to a 4 (more like a 4.5).\n  \nRead more","asin_in_url":"B074VF6ZLM","description":"The inspirational best seller that ignited a movement and asked us to find our why.\nDiscover the book that is captivating millions on TikTok and that served as the basis for one of the most popular TED Talks of all time - with more than 56 million views and counting. Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the why of their\u00a0organization.\u00a0Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever.\nStart with Why asks (and answers)\u00a0the questions: Why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?\nPeople like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with why. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the why behind it.\nStart with Why shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act, and communicate the same way - and it's the opposite of what everyone else does. Sinek calls this powerful idea The Golden Circle, and it provides a framework upon which organizations can be built, movements can be led, and people can be inspired. And it all starts with why.","price_upper":0,"pricing_str":"","pricing_url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/offer-listing\/B074VF6ZLM?startIndex=0","discount_end":"","manufacturer":"Simon Sinek, Penguin Audio","price_buybox":0,"product_name":"Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action","bullet_points":"","is_addon_item":false,"price_initial":0,"pricing_count":1,"reviews_count":34556,"sns_discounts":[],"developer_info":[],"lightning_deal":null,"price_shipping":0,"is_prime_pantry":false,"featured_merchant":[],"is_prime_eligible":false,"parse_status_code":12005,"answered_questions_count":0,"rating_stars_distribution":[{"rating":5,"percentage":74},{"rating":4,"percentage":16},{"rating":3,"percentage":6},{"rating":2,"percentage":2},{"rating":1,"percentage":2}]},"status_code":200,"url":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B074VF6ZLM","task_id":"7080865408512723969","created_at":"2023-07-01 11:11:09","updated_at":"2023-07-01 11:11:13"}]}
