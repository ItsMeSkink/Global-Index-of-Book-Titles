As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.' Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.' Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

    "description": "About the bookyou are born to blossom is an account of dr. A. P. J. Abdul kalam's vision for a better india with the need for fully utilizing the education and technology sector to achieve his aim of a new developed india. Using a tree as a metaphor, he states that different approaches towards learning need to be implemented for different age groups and there is a dire need for quality education and guidance to reach the footsteps of indian schools. Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists. 'there is no age to blossom,\" is the lingering concept throughout the book and dr. Kalam calls for a scientific mind molded by conscience and consensus, while taking into consideration indian morality and values. You are born to blossom was published in 2008 and is available in paperback.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India at 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world. He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation. This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning. The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom. He advocates creation of conditions that favour growth of diverse individual talents akin to a garden and calls for a scientific mind-set guided by conscience, consensus and by actions that take our social and moral values into account in building our own systems.",

Abdul kalam's vision for a better india with the need for fully utilizing the education and technology sector to achieve his aim of a new developed india. Using a tree as a metaphor, he states that different approaches towards learning need to be implemented for different age groups and there is a dire need for quality education and guidance to reach the footsteps of indian schools. Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists.

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India at 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world. He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation. This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions.

The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom.

    "description": "Every common man who by his sheer grit and hard work achieves success should share his story with the rest for they may find inspiration and strength to go on, in his story. The 'Wings of Fire' is one such autobiography by visionary scientist Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, who from very humble beginnings rose to be the President of India. The book is full of insights, personal moments and life experiences of Dr. Kalam. It gives us an understanding on his journey of success. Dr. Kalam by narrating his life journey evokes the reader to identify with one s inner fire and potential, for he was of the firm belief that each one of us was born with the strength and potential to make a tangible change in the world. How he inspired himself to achieve dreams and how he went about accomplishing so much is what the book captures nicely. The book recollects many anecdotes and stories from childhood, his time at school and college. The time spent at the Langley Research Center, NASA and Wallops Flight Facility gets a lot of attention. Personal tragedies have not been left out. The time when he lost his father and how he felt when conferred with many awards like the Padma Bhushan have been written in much detail. The second half of the book deals with Dr Kalam, the scientist who made a significant contribution in developing the countries guided missile program, a pioneering effort for the security of the nation. It's not with reason that he was nicknamed as the 'Missile Man of India'. The book also contains 24 photographs at various stages of his life.  Seller Inventory # B68\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "Not since Richard Wright's Native Son has the education of a young man been rendered as daringly, defiantly, and emotionally galvanizingly as in Murad Kalam's Night Journey. Night Journey is the story of Eddie Bloodpath, beautiful, oversized, awkward child of South Phoenix's Third Ward. Hefty and handsome, quiet and strong like his long-lost father, Eddie is the good son, seemingly immune to the powerful pull of the streets. His older brother, Turtle -- a frail, stuttering, grammar school dropout who was born to hustle -- isn't convinced that Eddie will stay out of trouble. Acting on instinct, Turtle plucks Eddie from the brink of the urban abyss and delivers him to the boxing gym. A perpetual innocent and reluctant pugilist, Eddie is adopted by a rogues' gallery of melancholy prizefighters, artful hustlers, strung-out mystics, pubescent crack lords, and drunken burnouts. He falls in love with Tessa, a hauntingly beautiful prostitute with whom he shares an unspeakable secret. Waiting in the wings is Marchalina, Eddie's high school crush, a privileged, bookish, North Phoenix girl who could save him from his worst instincts. When a senseless murder and its aftermath send Eddie running from the sun-washed landscape of the American Southwest, he tries to fight his way to safety -- first in Chicago, at the national amateur competition, and then in the surreal underworld of Las Vegas professional boxing. Rushing pell-mell toward manhood, Eddie must discover where his true allegiances lie. An American odyssey, Night Journey is a first novel equally remarkable for its raw power and wise empathy, borne up by Murad Kalam's unshakable belief in the ultimate grace of humanity.",

It was not only his extraordinary erudition that commanded respect, his awesome mastery of all the primary sources, Greek, Christian, Judaic, and Muslim; it was also his penetrating insight and his original and groundbreaking interpretations.In this long-awaited volume, on which he worked for twenty years, Wolfson describes the body of doctrine known as the Kalam. Kalam, an Arabic term meaning \"speech\" and hence \"discussion,\" was applied to early attempts in Islam to adduce philosophic proofs for religious beliefs. It later came to designate a system of religious philosophy which reached its highest point in the eleventh century; the masters of Kalam, known as Mutakallimum, were in many respects the Muslim equivalent of the Christian Church Fathers. Wolfson studies the Kalam systematically, unfolding its philosophic origins and implications and observing its repercussions in other religions. He scrutinizes the texts of Muslim writers for their treatment of such crucial problems as the attributes of God, the Creation, causality, predestination and free will. In the process he shows how the teachings of the Koran were constantly interwoven with ideas from Greek and Oriental philosophies, Judaism, and Christianity as Islamic thought developed.As lucidly written and intellectually stimulating as all the author's earlier books, this volume is a fitting capstone to a notable career.",

Wings of Fire: An Autobiography is an autobiographical novel that tells the readers a story about unlocking their inner potential. Kalam does a great deal to throw light on his journey to igniting the fire within himself. This book is divided into seven parts, and begins with an Introduction and Preface. This is then followed by an Orientation, which contains a quote from the Atharva Veda. After that, the readers are also enlightened on the incidents that made Kalam what he is today.  In the Orientation portion of the book, the readers are provided insights into the birth, childhood, and education of Kalam. This section covers his time at Schwartz High School and Madras Institute of Technology, as well as his middle class background in detail. The chapters that follow are Creation and Propitiation . He also reminisces the time he had at Langley Research Center, NASA, and Wallops Flight Facility. In the chapter Creation , Kalam delves into the time when his father passed away, to him being awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1981.  The final chapters deal with his life as a visionary scientist, where he reminisces the role he played in the guided missile development program, and making five formidable missiles. These achievements fetched Kalam the title of the Missile Man of India . This autobiography comes with 24 photos taken at different times in Kalam s life.

Dr. Kalam, who was India's eleventh President and has been a scientist and a teacher, has written more than twenty books. Ranging from inspirational and spiritual thoughts, to autobiographical reflections to his vision statements for a developed India, these works bear the imprint of a mind that is deeply reflective. For the first time, some of the most thoughtful, inspiring and educative of these writings have been compiled in one place in The Righteous Life. Some of the essays in this volume describe his early life, family and teachers and his entry into the world of scientific development and research. Also included are his thoughts on education, governance, probity in public life and his analysis and solutions to some of India's problems such as corruption, energy independence and the overall development of the country. Filled with wisdom and farsighted thinking that upholds honesty, diligence and spirituality, the Righteous Life showcases the working of one of the finest minds in the country.",

He met over 21 million children and young people in India and outside and spoke to them about the power of knowledge, ambition, moral behavior and the need to bring about change in society.

    "description": "Abdul Kalam has not only been one of the most inspiring leaders and scientists of this country, but has also been one of the most humane and the humblest geniuses of our times. In this book, he attempts to understand why the world is filled with elements of sadness, anxiety, stress, disharmony and pessimism among other negative forces that hinder the progress of mankind towards peace. Kalam poignantly shares his ideas of making this planet a better place to live, by evolving not only materialistically, but also harmoniously.",

    "description": "About the bookyou are born to blossom is an account of dr. A. P. J. Abdul kalam's vision for a better india with the need for fully utilizing the education and technology sector to achieve his aim of a new developed india. Using a tree as a metaphor, he states that different approaches towards learning need to be implemented for different age groups and there is a dire need for quality education and guidance to reach the footsteps of indian schools. Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists. 'there is no age to blossom,\" is the lingering concept throughout the book and dr. Kalam calls for a scientific mind molded by conscience and consensus, while taking into consideration indian morality and values.

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India at 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world. He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation. This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning. The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom.

Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

This is then followed by an Orientation, which contains a quote from the Atharva Veda. After that, the readers are also enlightened on the incidents that made Kalam what he is today.

This section covers his time at Schwartz High School and Madras Institute of Technology, as well as his middle class background in detail. The chapters that follow are Creation and Propitiation .

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.' Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

    "description": "When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium with Y.S. Rajan in 1998, little did they expect the magnitude of the response they would get. The idea that India could actually be a developed nation in a short time rather than remain condemned to a subsistence diet of marginal improvements and promises struck a chord among readers. The book continues to be a bestseller.  Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India goes the logical next step and examines why, given all our skills, resources and talents, we, so obviously capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What is it that we as a nation are missing? For at the heart of Ignited Minds is an irresistible premise: the people of a nation have the power, by dint of hard work, to realize their dream of a truly good life.  Kalam offers no formulaic prescription in Ignited Minds. Instead, he takes up different issues and themes that struck him on his pilgrimage around the country as he met thousands of school children, teachers, scientists and saints and seers in the course of two years: the necessity for a patriotism that transcends religion and politics; for role models who point out the path to take; and for confidence in ourselves and in our strengths.  Who was he to write on so large a theme, he wondered as he started writing this book. But at the end, Kalam's humility notwithstanding, this may well prove to be the book that motivates us to get back on the winning track and unleash the energy within a nation that hasn't allowed itself full rein.",

This book draws an unforgettable blue print of success for all. One lesson that shimmers from every page of this book is hope. Whether in failure or in success, there is always a clear vision of future. In human life as well as in the corporate world, the value of vision, leading to planning, followed by action should not be underestimated. The success smiles on those who dream and act.

While poems touch the heart and leave a deep impression, his prose leads you to think how to go beyond the rock walls of conditioning, perceptions and prejudices to achieve success and fulfilment.

He also states that several developed countries have directed their efforts towards setting up research centers across the country, which has benefited scientists, engineers, and professionals from various spheres.

In the beginning of this book, Kalam presents the readers with a question as to whether India can become a developed country. He then provides insights into the current situation in the country, and explains that this goal is a realistic one. In the subsequent chapters, Kalam and Rajan begin to examine the five industries that need to become reasonably self-sufficient in the coming years, and each chapter tells the readers what can be done to bring a positive change in each industry.  They also tell the readers about the current education system in the country, and the latest technology that can be used to improve the quality of education. The readers are also given insights into the present healthcare industry and infrastructural system, which are trademarks of a developed nation. Kalam and Rajan conclude by telling every individual and organization about the role they can play in transforming the nation by 2020.

    "description": "This book is an account of how Dr. Kalam visualizes Information and Communication Technology mining the rural talent. Here, Dr. Kalam presents his dream of schools in India in 2020 as symbiotic nerve centres connecting teachers, students and community; personifying knowledge that exists in the world.\u00a0He also makes a clarion call to accelerate the process of societal transformation. This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world, where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning.\u00a0The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom. He advocates creation of conditions that favour growth of diverse individual talents akin to a garden and calls for a scientific mind-set guided by conscience, consensus and actions that take our social and moral values into account in building our own systems.",

Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists.

Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead.  In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020.  India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

However, hundreds of millions of poor smallholder farmers who live in dry, impoverished areas had almost no access to these required resources.

The new revolution would help those forgotten poor to capitalize on the diversity and unique assets of their own environments, for example by growing higher value dryland crops to serve markets in urban areas both locally and beyond. We argued that this new revolution offers a promising pathway to food security and prosperity. Feeding the Forgotten Poor received an overwhelming response.

Prime Minister Modi took a decisive step to pluck the scourge of black money at its root, by demonetizing high-value currency notes, and though it caused much inconvenience the people were willing to brave it for the country. It was a resilient India's thirst for self-realization and heralded a new consciousness of the Indian people - one that seeks political willpower and integrity. India's future has been the ground of many contentions and to date, it remains the greatest and most far-reaching political experiment in human history. From being a democracy to its aspirations of being a global powerhouse - the world has looked on with curiosity the development of its rising billion. However, according to Arun Tiwari, many writings on India focus on its cerebral rather than identitarian aspects, and thus leave out a crucial piece in understanding India's national trajectory and future pedigree. India 3.0 is a step forward in this regard, as it is a geological exploration of the Indian mind, to know its psychology and temperament, its wounds and victories. A book of hope, India 3.0 analyses the three watersheds in Indian history - Independence (India 1.0), liberalization (India 2.0) and Demonetization (India 3.0) - and traces a path to India's vaunted destiny: of becoming a world leader.",

    "description": "The definitive biography of India's most loved leader and scientist. Aeronautical engineer, rocket scientist, missile man, visionary, teacher and the most inspiring head of state in living memory - Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was all these and more. Unquestionably the most revered Indian leader since Mahatma Gandhi, he transcended all the boundaries and obstacles that came his way in the course of a remarkable life and he did so with grace and humility. Arun Tiwari tells Dr Kalam's life story with a deep understanding of his formative experiences and character. He charts Dr Kalam's stratospheric rise to prominence as dramatic as the missiles he championed giving us unique glimpses into his struggle and tribulations. With the benefit of thirty-three years as Dr Kalam's 'subordinate scientist, co-author, speechwriter and friend', Arun Tiwari captures the essence of Kalam, his influences, his ascetic habits and his passions that fueled his remarkable life and achievements. Dr Kalam was a man whose expansive soul could combine ardent patriotism with a love of humanity and rigorous discipline with gentleness and sensitivity that is almost unparalleled in public life.

    "description": "The definitive biography of India's most loved leader and scientist. Aeronautical engineer, rocket scientist, missile man, visionary, teacher and the most inspiring head of state in living memory - Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was all these and more. Unquestionably the most revered Indian leader since Mahatma Gandhi, he transcended all the boundaries and obstacles that came his way in the course of a remarkable life and he did so with grace and humility. Arun Tiwari tells Dr Kalam's life story with a deep understanding of his formative experiences and character. He charts Dr Kalam's stratospheric rise to prominence as dramatic as the missiles he championed giving us unique glimpses into his struggle and tribulations. With the benefit of thirty-three years as Dr Kalam's 'subordinate scientist, co-author, speechwriter and friend', Arun Tiwari captures the essence of Kalam, his influences, his ascetic habits and his passions that fueled his remarkable life and achievements. Dr Kalam was a man whose expansive soul could combine ardent patriotism with a love of humanity and rigorous discipline with gentleness and sensitivity that is almost unparalleled in public life. This authoritative portrait of Dr Kalam, enriched by personal experiences and anecdotes, reveals him as a man personifying all the glory and paradoxes of his nation: Secular and religious; Exalted and humble; Schooled and unaffected; Dynamic and calm; Scientific and spiritual - An Indian above all.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.' Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy. It is a continuing saga, above all, of a journey - individual and collective - that will take India to 2020 and beyond as a developed nation.",

    "description": "When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium with Y.S. Rajan in 1998, little did they expect the magnitude of the response they would get. The idea that India could actually be a developed nation in a short time rather than remain condemned to a subsistence diet of marginal improvements and promises struck a chord among readers. The book continues to be a bestseller.  Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India goes the logical next step and examines why, given all our skills, resources and talents, we, so obviously capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What is it that we as a nation are missing? For at the heart of Ignited Minds is an irresistible premise: the people of a nation have the power, by dint of hard work, to realize their dream of a truly good life.  Kalam offers no formulaic prescription in Ignited Minds. Instead, he takes up different issues and themes that struck him on his pilgrimage around the country as he met thousands of school children, teachers, scientists and saints and seers in the course of two years: the necessity for a patriotism that transcends religion and politics; for role models who point out the path to take; and for confidence in ourselves and in our strengths.  Who was he to write on so large a theme, he wondered as he started writing this book. But at the end, Kalam's humility notwithstanding, this may well prove to be the book that motivates us to get back on the winning track and unleash the energy within a nation that hasn't allowed itself full rein.",

    "description": "Mission India: A Vision For Indian Youth has been written with the intention of challenging the Indian youth to bring about a positive change in the country by 2020. Kalam starts off by telling the readers that there has never been a time in Indian history such as this, where the nation has 540 million youth and 20 million Indians across the globe. He also states that several developed countries have directed their efforts towards setting up research centers across the country, which has benefited scientists, engineers, and professionals from various spheres.  Kalam and Rajan tell the readers about their goal to make India one among the five top economic powers in the world by 2020. In the beginning of this book, Kalam presents the readers with a question as to whether India can become a developed country. He then provides insights into the current situation in the country, and explains that this goal is a realistic one. In the subsequent chapters, Kalam and Rajan begin to examine the five industries that need to become reasonably self-sufficient in the coming years, and each chapter tells the readers what can be done to bring a positive change in each industry.  They also tell the readers about the current education system in the country, and the latest technology that can be used to improve the quality of education. The readers are also given insights into the present healthcare industry and infrastructural system, which are trademarks of a developed nation. Kalam and Rajan conclude by telling every individual and organization about the role they can play in transforming the nation by 2020. Mission India: A Vision For Indian Youth has sold over 2,20,000 copies and has been translated into many languages including Serbian, Chinese, Sinhalese, and Tamil.",

This would involve raising the standards of governance and safeguarding the sanctity of public institutions. The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world, where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning.\u00a0The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom.

Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead.  In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020.  India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching.

    "description": "When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium with Y.S. Rajan in 1998, little did they expect the magnitude of the response they would get. The idea that India could actually be a developed nation in a short time rather than remain condemned to a subsistence diet of marginal improvements and promises struck a chord among readers. The book continues to be a bestseller.  Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India goes the logical next step and examines why, given all our skills, resources and talents, we, so obviously capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What is it that we as a nation are missing? For at the heart of Ignited Minds is an irresistible premise: the people of a nation have the power, by dint of hard work, to realize their dream of a truly good life.  Kalam offers no formulaic prescription in Ignited Minds. Instead, he takes up different issues and themes that struck him on his pilgrimage around the country as he met thousands of school children, teachers, scientists and saints and seers in the course of two years: the necessity for a patriotism that transcends religion and politics; for role models who point out the path to take; and for confidence in ourselves and in our strengths.  Who was he to write on so large a theme, he wondered as he started writing this book. But at the end, Kalam's humility notwithstanding, this may well prove to be the book that motivates us to get back on the winning track and unleash the energy within a nation that hasn't allowed itself full rein.",

    "description": "The thoughts of A P J Abdul Kalam, in You Are Unique, with their heartfelt sincerity, chiselled logic and experienced intuition are amazing lamps on the path of life, giving strength to seek one's Unique Self. This book draws an unforgettable blue print of success for all. One lesson that shimmers from every page of this book is hope. Whether in failure or in success, there is always a clear vision of future. In human life as well as in the corporate world, the value of vision, leading to planning, followed by action should not be underestimated. The success smiles on those who dream and act. A message of spirituality, honesty, being unselfish and the value of giving emerges from these pages as from his life.

The book uses the metaphor of a tree to describe the process of knowledge bearing fruits of prosperity in the contemporary globalised world, where different phases, formative, adult working life, and post-50 experienced senior citizens, call for different kinds of learning.\u00a0The book refers to a contextual contribution of a large number of Indian scientists and artists and proves that there is no age bar to blossom. He advocates creation of conditions that favour growth of diverse individual talents akin to a garden and calls for a scientific mind-set guided by conscience, consensus and actions that take our social and moral values into account in building our own systems.",

Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists.

Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead.  In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020.  India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

As I was returning to my room in the evening, the vice-chancellor, Prof. A. Kalanidhi, fell in step with me. Someone had been frantically trying to get in touch with me through the day, he said. Indeed, the phone was ringing when I entered the room. When I answered, a voice at the other end said, 'The prime minister wants to talk with you.' Some months earlier, I had left my post as Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India to return to teaching. Now, as I spoke to the PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, my life was set for an unexpected change.' Turning Points takes up the incredible Kalam story from where Wings of Fire left off. It brings together details from his career and presidency that are not generally known as he speaks out for the first time on certain points of controversy.

    "description": "When A.P.J. Abdul Kalam wrote India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium with Y.S. Rajan in 1998, little did they expect the magnitude of the response they would get. The idea that India could actually be a developed nation in a short time rather than remain condemned to a subsistence diet of marginal improvements and promises struck a chord among readers. The book continues to be a bestseller.  Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India goes the logical next step and examines why, given all our skills, resources and talents, we, so obviously capable of being the best, settle so often for the worst. What is it that we as a nation are missing? For at the heart of Ignited Minds is an irresistible premise: the people of a nation have the power, by dint of hard work, to realize their dream of a truly good life.  Kalam offers no formulaic prescription in Ignited Minds. Instead, he takes up different issues and themes that struck him on his pilgrimage around the country as he met thousands of school children, teachers, scientists and saints and seers in the course of two years: the necessity for a patriotism that transcends religion and politics; for role models who point out the path to take; and for confidence in ourselves and in our strengths.  Who was he to write on so large a theme, he wondered as he started writing this book. But at the end, Kalam's humility notwithstanding, this may well prove to be the book that motivates us to get back on the winning track and unleash the energy within a nation that hasn't allowed itself full rein.",

He receives hundreds of emails every day and answers them with utmost patience. This book is based on the questions that he has been asked over the years. In these questions, people are usually seeking solutions to problems they face in their lives. Kalam asserts that if we can change the way we process the way we think about tackling our problems, then we can possibly change the way we arrive at solutions. This idea also happens to be the underlying theme in his answers. Dr. Kalam draws from his own experiences of life, and from reading books and interactions with numerous political and spiritual leaders while answering his mails. His replies are presented in this title in a way that they send out a holistic message for anyone who is going through trying times in his or her life.",

Kalam starts off by telling the readers that there has never been a time in Indian history such as this, where the nation has 540 million youth and 20 million Indians across the globe. He also states that several developed countries have directed their efforts towards setting up research centers across the country, which has benefited scientists, engineers, and professionals from various spheres.  Kalam and Rajan tell the readers about their goal to make India one among the five top economic powers in the world by 2020. In the beginning of this book, Kalam presents the readers with a question as to whether India can become a developed country. He then provides insights into the current situation in the country, and explains that this goal is a realistic one. In the subsequent chapters, Kalam and Rajan begin to examine the five industries that need to become reasonably self-sufficient in the coming years, and each chapter tells the readers what can be done to bring a positive change in each industry.  They also tell the readers about the current education system in the country, and the latest technology that can be used to improve the quality of education. The readers are also given insights into the present healthcare industry and infrastructural system, which are trademarks of a developed nation. Kalam and Rajan conclude by telling every individual and organization about the role they can play in transforming the nation by 2020.

Abdul kalam's vision for a better india with the need for fully utilizing the education and technology sector to achieve his aim of a new developed india. Using a tree as a metaphor, he states that different approaches towards learning need to be implemented for different age groups and there is a dire need for quality education and guidance to reach the footsteps of indian schools. Dr. Kalam addresses these issues as he recounts his experiences as a schoolboy. The other theme prevailing in the book is social transformation - where the communication and information sector can help mine rural talent. He talks about how the development of divergent individual talents can help in bringing about a change, taking into consideration the social and moral values of the nation. You are born to blossom comprises of eight chapters that talk about many core issues related to society - like personifying the knowledge that's prevalent around the world, the standard of governance in public institutions and how to safeguard their sanctity. It also talks about adult working life and opportunities for senior citizens past the age of 50. It also takes into account the contributions of a number of indian artists and scientists. 'there is no age to blossom,\" is the lingering concept throughout the book and dr. Kalam calls for a scientific mind molded by conscience and consensus, while taking into consideration indian morality and values.

Rajan published the now iconic India 2020, a vision document for the new millennium that charted how India could become one of the top five economic powers in the world by 2020. Sixteen years later, as the year 2020 approaches, it is time to take stock of how much India has achieved and what lies ahead.  In many ways, India s growth story in the twenty-first century has been hamstrung by missed opportunities and slowdowns in project execution; but it has also been marked by new opportunities and emerging technologies that make faster and more inclusive growth viable. A renewed policy focus is now needed for agriculture, manufacturing, mining, the chemicals industry, health care and infrastructure to invigorate these sectors and boost economic growth, argue Kalam and Rajan. Alongside, education, job creation, emerging technologies, biodiversity, waste management, national security and the knowledge economy are some of the other vital areas that we need to build on as we look beyond 2020.  India can still make it to the list of developed nations in a decade. Beyond 2020 provides an action plan for that transformation.",

Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

    "description": "On 8 November 2016, India radically changed its future course, a change that has precedent only in such momentous occasions in Indian history as the Independence (India 1.0) and economic liberalization (India 2.0). Prime Minister Modi took a decisive step to pluck the scourge of black money at its root, by demonetizing high-value currency notes, and though it caused much inconvenience the people were willing to brave it for the country. It was a resilient India's thirst for self-realization and heralded a new consciousness of the Indian people - one that seeks political willpower and integrity. India's future has been the ground of many contentions and to date, it remains the greatest and most far-reaching political experiment in human history. From being a democracy to its aspirations of being a global powerhouse - the world has looked on with curiosity the development of its rising billion. However, according to Arun Tiwari, many writings on India focus on its cerebral rather than identitarian aspects, and thus leave out a crucial piece in understanding India's national trajectory and future pedigree. India 3.0 is a step forward in this regard, as it is a geological exploration of the Indian mind, to know its psychology and temperament, its wounds and victories. A book of hope, India 3.0 analyses the three watersheds in Indian history - Independence (India 1.0), liberalization (India 2.0) and Demonetization (India 3.0) - and traces a path to India's vaunted destiny: of becoming a world leader.",

This is then followed by an Orientation, which contains a quote from the Atharva Veda. After that, the readers are also enlightened on the incidents that made Kalam what he is today.  In the Orientation portion of the book, the readers are provided insights into the birth, childhood, and education of Kalam. This section covers his time at Schwartz High School and Madras Institute of Technology, as well as his middle class background in detail. The chapters that follow are Creation and Propitiation . He also reminisces the time he had at Langley Research Center, NASA, and Wallops Flight Facility. In the chapter Creation , Kalam delves into the time when his father passed away, to him being awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1981.

    "description": "Pramukh Swamiji, one of the most inspiring spiritual leaders of modern times and the fifth spiritual successor of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, is the inheritor of a legacy of enlightened gurus that goes back to the early nineteenth century. Pramukh Swamiji became, through a chance meeting, friend to one of India's most eminent citizens, the eleventh president of India, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and together they created an unparalleled fellowship of science and spirituality. In Transcendence, Dr Kalam, with his co-author and pupil Arun Tiwari, maps a journey of self-realization reflected in the compassionate eyes of Pramukh Swamiji, painting a delightfully open-hearted portrait of the fusion of spirituality, science and leadership. His candid vignettes from life on the centre stage of Indian technology and societal missions, Indian politics and world affairs are interwoven with revelations of a profound connection with Swamiji. He describes how his path has been illuminated by Swamiji's words and his inspirational, loving presence. Through the life of Pramukh Swamiji and the transnational work of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha, Dr Kalam traces the contemporary concerns of the Indian diaspora across the world and the emerging Indian identity of a capable, right-thinking and hardworking people. Drawing from the lives of great scientists and creative leaders, Transcendence captures the essence of all religions and is as much a fountain of inspiration and a treasury of wisdom as it is a tribute to the multi-faith, pluralistic Indian society.",

These alternatives are inter-related and inter-dependent and both should, therefore, go hand in hand for achieving the laudable objectives, There has been demand from the learned readers to bring out the revised edition of the book \"Adult and Non-Formal Education\". Since a lot of changes have taken place in the national scenario of Adult and Non-Formal Education, it is really essential to deal with these new changes and make it up-to-date. The chapter \"development of adult education by 2001\" gives a comprehensive review and growth of adult education in India including the latest trends and issues. The chapter on \"literacy : critical factor for the knowledge revolution\" discusses the emerging need, importance and challenges of the information/knowledge revolution in our country. The chapter \"life long learning for a literate India : our future perspective\" deals with the concept of life long education/learning and the pressing needs for a literate India to cope up with the present transaction and the future perspective. Since evaluation has assumed more significance and taken new dimensions, the chapter on \"concurrent evaluation : its meaning, need and methods\" was felt significant for the revised edition. The chapter \"development of teaching-learning material in adult education\" is felt very useful for providing suitable teaching and learning material for different groups of clientele. The chapter \"development of non-formal education by 2001\" gives a detailed picture of non-formal education in India with most of the latest trends and issues.

This book Deaf and Dumb Education has brought out excellent advanced knowledge and concepts at the international level available in the field of special education which has lost its borders now a days. It has presented the most up to date and latest ideas and practices enriched and supported by empirical evidences and research findings. Due to reinvention of special education the responsibilities of General and special education have been redefined and reinforced. The deaf and dumb children are no longer called handicapped and they demand accommodation and other facilities along with other ordinary students. They are rather more assisted with more scientific techniques and sophisticated aids and demand more attention and support from the society and governments. The chapters provide both a broad context for understanding the educational development of deaf and dumb children and an outline for fostering their growth. It is hoped that with the latest ideas and modern technologies the technical workers teachers and researchers concerned with deaf and dumb education will be in a better position to help the deaf and dumb people. 311 pp.  Seller Inventory # 53225\n        Contact seller",

Bibliography. Index. School management is an emerging concept with empirical and theoretical implications. This book is an indepth study of school administration and organisation and gives modern ideas about various issues and trends in school management. In recent years it has been felt that for success of any educational schemes and projects a good structure of management and qualified personnel are essential. School being the lowest and oldest structure needs to be revamped and reoriented to the current needs and requirements. This is a book which contains a very reasoned non polemical and systematic analysis of the major types of efforts to change and improve schools. At the same time it indicates why most of these efforts have produced meagre results. The reasons are many but among the most important are those that have to do with matters of scope implementation substantive focus a shallow conception of the culture of the school and the purposes of schooling. The book is directed toward a clientele of students in school management theory and problem analysis groups as well as to school administrators seeking to examine their problems and policies from perspectives that go beyond their own personal experience. The book will provide readers with a logical structure for describing documenting and analysing school problems and methodological insights that go beyond those currently available in the literature. 290 pp.  Seller Inventory # 53101\n        Contact seller",

    "description": "Impact of Organisational Culture on OCB (Organisational Citizenship Behaviour): A Comparative Analysis, is an attempt to integrate two separate disciplines in the behavioral science landscape. OCB caught the attention of the academicians and practitioners not long back. While academicians tried to link OCB with other Organisational Behaviours like commitment, procedural justice, positive mood, leadership, personality and others, the practitioners were busy finding out the reasons for reducing Organizatinal Loyalty, high turnover and low commitment to work. But, very little attention has been diverted to understanding Organizational Culture as a predictor of extra - role behaviours. The current work is an attempt to link Organisational Culture as a precursor of certain Behaviors that goes beyond the Organizational rule book. I believe the work will of value to people having interest in people and behavioural dynamics. Individuals having academic and research interest may find this work useful in widening their research perspective. Also, the practioners can benefit by linking different factors of their Organisational Culture to elicit Citizenship Behaviours from employees.",
